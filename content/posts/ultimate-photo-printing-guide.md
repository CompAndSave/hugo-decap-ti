Photo printing at home has become more and more popular over time, and it's no surprise. With the advanced photo printers on the market these days, it's much easier to print from home instead of getting pictures professionally printed. Not only does this save time and money, but as long as you have the correct supplies, you can't even tell a difference! From printer to paper, we've got you covered on what you need.![photo printing](/blog/images/archive/2016/09/Fotolia_9120057_Subscription_Monthly_XL.jpg)

### All-In-One vs. Photo Printing

First, you need to make sure you are using a printer that has photo printing capabilities. They are many models out there that are made exclusively for photo printing that produce beautiful prints. However, if you also print documents and emails often, it may be beneficial to check out an All-In-One model. Even though it is not specifically made to print photos, this is still a great option for saving money on prints and getting high-quality photos.

### Inkjet vs. Toner

When choosing between inkjet and toner, you need to keep your printing requirements in mind. For photo printing, inkjet printers usually produce high-contrast, vivid colors that results in better quality photos when compared to toner printers.

### Photo Paper

Make sure you choose the right kind of paper for your photo printing project - it can make all the difference! Here's a rundown on the different types out there and how they are used:

**[Glossy](https://www.tomatoink.com/paper/photo-paper/glossy)** \- The most widely used type of paper which ranges in degrees of glossiness. Common for printing photos, the glossy shine helps small details pop out. However, the gloss may create glares from some viewpoints.

**[Matte](https://www.tomatoink.com/paper/photo-paper/matte)** \- Matte is not glossy and a cheaper option. Commonly used to print large quantities for flyers, large quantities of marketing collateral or in black and white.

**[Lustre](https://www.tomatoink.com/paper/photo-paper/lustre)** \- Has a satin finish with a textured feel. Produces more professional prints.

**[Canvas](https://www.tomatoink.com/paper/photo-paper/canvas)** \- A heavy weight paper with a coated, textured surface that replicates the feel of a canvas. Because it produces long lasting prints, canvas paper is most commonly used with paintings.

**[Transfer Paper](https://www.tomatoink.com/paper/transfer-paper/inkjet)** \- With transfer paper, you can print out any design and create a unique, iron-on transfer that you can then iron onto any type of fabric that you desire.

**[Magnetic Sheets](https://www.tomatoink.com/paper/magnet-sheets)** \- Great for printing small photos that you can hang on the fridge.

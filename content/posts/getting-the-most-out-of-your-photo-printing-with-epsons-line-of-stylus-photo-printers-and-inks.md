The digital movement has taken over the photographic community (for good reason) and you are hard pressed these days to find a shooter using film. This massive shift in the way that we take photographs hasn't really changed the way we share photographs. Yes, you can email your photos, share them on Facebook, Flickr, or the multitude of other photo sharing websites out there nowadays, but there is still something endearing, captivating, and heartwarming about a printed image. People still want printed photos, and they likely will for a very long time to come.

Printing your digital photos can be an expensive and confusing process with options out there ranging from your local pharmacy to high-end, online print labs that can charge hundreds for one large print. However there is a third option that many people forget: at home printing. With the right combination of printer and inks, [you can print your digital photographs](https://www.tomatoink.com/paper) at home and be sure that they will last for years to come!

When accompanied with the correct paper choices, and proper display conditions, it can produce prints that provide lightfastness for up to 108 years with color and over 200 year for black and white images!

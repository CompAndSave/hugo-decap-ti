Our requirement for printing things – letters, documents, contracts, brochures and so on – uses up ink and creates waste out of the empty or exhausted ink cartridges. The problem is that these used cartridges typically are tossed in the trash and then end up in landfills; something that you would surely want to avoid! So what can you do prevent such electronic waste landing up in landfill? Here are some tips to recycle and some do-it-yourself ideas to upscale your used ink cartridges.

Many ink and toner cartridge manufacturers accept empty cartridges, which are then checked for integrity, refilled and then resold as [remanufactured cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/environmentally-friendly-green-ink-and-toner-cartridges). Instructions for returning cartridges to the manufacturer are generally printed on the package. You can either drop them off to the retail outlets listed or you can use a pre-paid shipping label or envelope to send off the used items to the manufacturer or recycler.

It is also possible to get cash in return for empty cartridges; some may pay up to $4 for a used cartridge. You can either take the cash or have the proceeds donated to a charity of your choice. (Check to see what cartridges are accepted however, many of these recycling sites may not accept all types of cartridges)

Regular readers have already used our free pintables for St. Patrick's Day, Valentine's Day, the Chinese New Year and many other observances. This month we bring you **free printables for Father's Day** which falls on June 15 this year (third Sunday of each June). So here's how you can make the day a little bit more meaningful for that special guy in your life called dad.

### **Print a shirt card**

We had the idea that generic store bought cards tend to look rather the same so we thought of a shirt and necktie card instead. All you need to do is click on this link to the [**Printable Shirt Card PDF**](/blog/images/archive/2018/11/2014-fathers-day-TI.pdf) file and take a printout. Now cut along the dashed lines and fold as indicated. Also cut out the tie shape and insert that under the ‘collar'. You can now write your own special message to dad or get the kids to write out something special for their dad.

### **Print a mustache card**

[![Printable Father's Day Cards](/blog/images/archive/2014/06/Snap55.jpg)](/blog/images/archive/2014/06/Snap55.jpg)These are really cute too – our mustache cards. Whether dad has a mustache or not, we're sure one of these mustache types will suit his personality. Also, dad is definitely going to be pleased with that little play on words – fan(stache)tic! This is also a simple print out to take: click on the [**Mustache Card PDF**](/blog/images/archive/2018/11/2014-fathers-day-TI-2.pdf) link and take a printout. Add your special message and you're done!

Use these pintables as a father's day greeting or as a gift tag; you can even print out several and string them together to make a festive wall hanging or party décor.

### **Check out our canvas paper**

If you're wondering what type of paper to use for these printouts, check out our special [**Canvas Paper**](https://www.tomatoink.com/paper/photo-paper/canvas). This is textured inkjet photo paper that gives you that canvas look and feel. The surface of the paper is specially coated with resin to give this textured appearance, rather like professional canvas. The water resistant, scratch proof paper is great for printing out digital photos because the results are great and printouts last much longer too.

### **Don't forget your discount**

We're sweetening the deal further with our special Father's Day discount offer.

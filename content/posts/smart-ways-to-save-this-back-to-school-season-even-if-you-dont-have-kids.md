![Save on Back to School Season](/blog/images/archive/2015/08/2015-08-05-300x6001.png)If you have kids or grand kids who are heading back to school about now, you are probably busy getting all that [back to school shopping](https://www.tomatoink.com/blog/posts/back-to-school-tips-for-parents.html) done in time. But did you know, there are a lot of benefits to be had from all these sales that are going on, even if you don't have kids (or grandkids)? For instance you can buy gifts, office and home supplies at great rates. You can even enjoy tax rebates offered around this time of year. So take advantage of back to school sales… so what if you don't have school going kids!

## **Buy School and Office Supplies For the Home**

Some items always required around the house are: electronics, stationery such as pens, paper, notebooks, post-it notes, craft supplies, backpacks, markers, etc. You will also find sports gear, furniture, personal hygiene & skin care products and cleaning materials at these stores that have back to school supplies sales. Several of these sales have groceries as well since many parents like to pack food supplies for their kid's dorm room and so on. You can stock up on all these items now, while you are most likely to get the best deals.

## **Get stuff for your office or home office**

Whether you work outside the home or you work from home, you may need to stock up for several items: computers and computer peripherals, accessories and other electronics. Plus you may need furniture such as office desks, chairs, storage solutions and so on. Items such as planners, calendars, organizational tools, display boards, white boards and so on are other items you can get for your office. Again, now is a good time to shop: check out the school stuff as well as the office supplies segment to find all that you need.

## **Stock up on gift items**

You may also want to take a look at these sales to see what gift items you can find. That way if you're invited to dinner at short notice, you may have some gift worthy item at home and not have to rush out to buy one at the last moment: a book, some quality writing paper and so on. You could also stock up on some stocking filler type items well in advance of the holidays or even Halloween, to save yourself some of the headache of holiday shopping.

## **Take advantage of the tax break**

Many states offer tax free weekends around this time of year, to help parents shop back to school items. Many retailers add further discounts to sweeten the deal around these weekends to be sure to take advantage of these. [Check to see when each state offers this tax holiday](http://www.passionforsavings.com/back-to-school-tax-free-weekend/), what products are tax exempt and also check the amounts up to which tax is exempt. Do read the fine print though: only some products may be exempt. For instance only kids' Halloween costumes are exempt in Texas and not costumes for adults. Since not all states offer a tax holiday and since the exemptions differ from state to state, don't assume that your shopping is all tax free over that weekend.

## **Use our coupon code**

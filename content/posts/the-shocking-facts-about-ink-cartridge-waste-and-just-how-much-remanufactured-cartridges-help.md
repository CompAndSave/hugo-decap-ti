Everyone knows they should recycle, but there is big difference between knowing you should recycle and actually doing it. Sometimes all that people need is a little motivation and some real facts to help them make the switch to actually doing great things for the environment. Tossing used ink cartridges in the trash seems like a small thing to worry about, after all, they usually aren't that big, and you can't do anything else with them anyway right? Wrong! There is a huge opportunity for all homes and businesses to help recycle and save money at the same time!

Did you know that every single year 400,000 tons of plastic and metal are dropped into landfills thanks to tossing out used [ink cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/)? That's a lot of waste that can be easily avoided! Contrary to what ink manufacturers want you to think, ink cartridges are not a one-time-use item, in fact, they can be refilled up to 15 times! Remanufactured cartridges are just that. A company obtains empty ink cartridges that have been turned in for recycling, and then they clean them, test them, repair them if necessary, and then refill them with fresh ink. These cartridges are of the same quality as new ones from the manufacturer but [can be purchased for up to 80% less.](https://www.tomatoink.com/)

Remanufactured cartridges work just as well, sometimes better, than original manufacturer cartridges, are good for the environment, and save you money too! It's commonly known that replacement ink from the original manufacturer can often cost as much as the printer itself, but it doesn't have to be that way. By choosing remanufactured ink cartridges you can save big money and keep huge amounts of waste out of landfills each year. Well over 90% of the materials used to make ink cartridges are recyclable and they are just being tossed away into the trash. Your office or home can help make the change simply by recycling your used cartridges and then continuing to purchase remanufactured cartridges as replacements.

Thousands and thousands of cartridges are thrown away each year, with some estimates as high as 13 cartridges per second just in the United States, and it can take up to 1000 years for a single cartridge's components to decompose. That means that every single cartridge you throw away today could still be around 10 generations from now! We all have a responsibility to take care of the planet and its resources, if not for ourselves, then for future generations. [Recycling ink cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/environmentally-friendly-green-ink-and-toner-cartridges) and choosing to purchase remanufactured replacements provides an easy, convenient, and cost effective way to help make the planet a better place for us all.

Many people are shocked to hear just how serious the facts about cartridge waste are, and it's true, they are quite shocking, but thankfully, you can easily help change them. Always remember to recycle old cartridges, don't just toss them. If you don't want to make a trip for each individual empty cartridge, simple keep a bag or container near the printer where you can drop in old cartridges and take them all at once to a recycling drop. Make a change in your habits now, and your wallet and the planet will thank you later![Subscribe here](https://www.tomatoink.com/welcome/subscribe) to get fresh discounts for your future purchases.

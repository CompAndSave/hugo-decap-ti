Spring is in the air! It is the time of year to throw open the windows, lace up your hiking boots, and breathe in the wonderful fresh air and warmth seeping into our surroundings. It can feel positively wonderful to get out into nature and appreciate what Mother Earth has to offer. Now might be a good time to ask: would Mother Earth approve of how we are giving back?

The concept of "spring cleaning" can be applied to our home, [office space](https://www.tomatoink.com/blog/posts/12-easy-ways-make-home-office-eco-friendly.html), car, and even clearing out the cobwebs in our minds. But we can also use this time to take a closer look at our daily habits and see how truly eco-friendly they are (or aren't).

Here's how you can start making your spring routine green. Examine the areas of your life where you can make some small, environmentally friendly tweaks. See what sticks and then move onto the next area where improvements can be made. By the time summer hits, you'll be making Mother Earth very proud.

# Make Your Spring Routine Green

### **1\. How You Get to Work**

What is your usual mode of transportation to and from work? If it's driving in a car, there are ways to easily reduce your carbon footprint. Carpooling can literally slash emissions by half (or more!), depending on how many people you ride with every day. If there's someone who lives on your route to work, offer to pick them up on the way. You'll help save the planet and might create a friendship out of an office acquaintanceship!

If public transportation runs smoothly (and nearby your home) in your city, try opting for it a few days a week. As the weather warms up, there is also the option of biking to work. This method is great for your own health, as well as the health of the planet.

Another detail to consider is running errands. If the grocery store or post office is on the way, make time to stop by these spots during your usual commute. It will save time, gas, and emissions in the long run.

### **2\. How You Spring-Clean Your Home**

The most satisfying part of spring, for some, is rolling up the sleeves and deep cleaning the entire home. Not only does it feel great afterward to look around at your sparkling-clean abode, but you will also increase the longevity of your appliances and home hardware when you give it some TLC.

If you are using harsh chemicals to deep-clean your space, however, you might not actually be doing your home — or the environment — a favor. Luckily, there is a plethora of information on how to use simple, [Earth-friendly ingredients](https://www.tomatoink.com/blog/posts/green-cleaning-your-home.html) to clean just about anything. Baking soda, vinegar, biodegradable soaps, and lemons are just about all you need to get any surface shining and grime free. This includes your plumbing! Baking soda and vinegar can unclog a drain in a heartbeat and grinding some lemon peel and juice in your garbage disposal can make your sink sweet-smelling.

### **3\. How Much Disposable Packaging You Buy**

There are folks out there who aspire to be as close to "zero waste" as possible. This way of life can take some serious dedication to start, but — like any other habit — can become second nature sooner than you think.

One of the easiest ways to reduce the amount of disposable (and often non-biodegradable) waste you purchase is by looking at your grocery store haul. Cardboard, plastic, glass, plastic, aluminum, and **PLASTIC** dominate food packaging nowadays. It can be tough to avoid it altogether, yet there are ways to reduce our environmental impact.

Firstly, make sure your recycling game is on point. The recyclable materials you buy should always find their way to the appropriate facility. Your city or apartment complex might have curbside pick-up or a designated drop-off spot for recyclables. Ensure that you know how to separate these items and where to put them.

Secondly, take inventory of the things you buy and how you could reduce their packaging. For instance, bulk items (oatmeal, rice, seeds, nuts, and even spices) can be purchased with reusable cloth bags or glass containers. Bring them with you when you visit the store and buy only what you need. This will help your budget as well!

Take things a step further by asking yourself which foods in your cart could be easily made at home. Maybe taking a Sunday afternoon to make a big batch of marinara, and freezing the leftovers, will cut down on the amount of store-bought sauce you buy. Perhaps the granola you buy every week to top your smoothies can be replicated at home. You can find all kinds of easy ways to create your own condiments, sauces, snacks, soups, breads, and juices in your own kitchen. Pick one item to start and see where this new lifestyle takes you.

### **4\. How Much Home Cooking You Do**

Speaking of creating your pantry staples at home, what about your main meals? If your favorite take-out joint knows you by name, it might be time to invest more time in the kitchen. By cooking up batches of delicious soups, stews, curries, casseroles, pilafs, and cold salads, you can make an entire week's worth (or longer, if you freeze your leftovers) of food without dropping lots of dough. Bring your lunch to work in [eco-friendly containers](https://www.tomatoink.com/blog/posts/greenest-gear-national-pack-your-lunch-day.html) for extra credit!

One more thing to consider when it comes to [home cooking](https://www.tomatoink.com/blog/posts/how-to-clean-up-and-green-up-your-eating-for-the-new-year.html) is reducing your animal product consumption. Incorporating more plant-based foods in your diet will greatly help the environment and expand your culinary skills and tastes.

### **5\. How Long-Lasting Your Clothing Truly Is**

As someone who appreciates a discount and the feeling of walking away with a great deal, I understand the allure of clothing sales. T-shirts for $2?! My first reaction is to say "Sign me up!" However, these items are not as much of a bargain as we might think.

Americans throw away [13 million tons of textiles](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/how-to-stop-13-million-tons-of-clothing-from-getting-trashed-every-year/) every year, which accounts for 9 percent of all non-recycled waste that ends up in landfills. The cycle of buying cheap (in quality and in price) clothing, only to toss it when it starts falling apart in a few months, is no good at all for the environment — or our checkbooks — in the long run. The cost of throwing away clothing hits us and Mother Earth in the gut.

There are ways to do better, however. Seeking out quality, environmentally responsible garments from [companies who care](http://ecocult.com/2015/the-18-most-affordable-places-to-buy-ethical-fashion/) about how their product affects the planet is an important shift. Making this transition can be more costly up front, however, which might make some people shy away. However, purchasing clothing that is actually meant to last means fewer of it will end up in landfills over time. Shopping at thrift stores and hosting a clothing swap with friends are other great ways to avoid tossing away textiles. Every step counts.

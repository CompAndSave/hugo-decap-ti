The year 2012 saw a continued steady rise in internet, or e-commerce sales. In the third quarter the total of e-commerce sales totaled over $55 billion, an increase of 3.7% from the second quarter. These sales now account for around 5% of total sales, up from about 1.5% in 2003.5% doesn't sound like a lot, but that percentage is increasing as warehousing and distribution systems get better and more efficient. 

Of course, some things don't do well in the new sales models; other products and companies seem custom made for an online distribution system, and industries have grown by large amounts since the advent of efficient ordering and delivery systems.

**SOME BUSINESSES ARE A NATURAL MATCH FOR E-TAILING**

The computer and printing industry has seen both a boom in business in the last ten years even as prices on devices have gone steadily down, and the industry of supply and peripherals has grown just as much. Traditionally, retailers use add-on's as an easy way to increase the profit; for computers, you are looking at anything from upgraded keyboards and mouse's to better monitors. For printers, they are looking to keep selling you specialty papers and inks.

When looking at add on sales across any industry this is where a lot of the profit is, and it allows the seller to lower the price of the computer or printer.

And that is one area where online sales have been able to save individuals and business money. If a 22" monitor at the store is $459.00 and you can get it online for $329.00, for many people that is an obvious choice. Paper, especially for [photo printers](https://www.tomatoink.com/paper), is going to be sold through brick and mortar stores. This is in large part due to the weight. If you compare prices from [online suppliers](https://www.tomatoink.com/) to that of local stores, most times the prices will be very similar once all the fees are added in.

Ink is another story; online ink suppliers have gotten very good at making compatible cartridges, or remanufacturing OEM cartridges. In both of these processes, manufacturing is very important, and the ink formulations are just as important as the cartridge itself. Without both pieces performing, the end product would be unacceptable.

One of the best ways to tell whether you are dealing with a company that puts the necessary care and attention into their product, talk to customer service, and make sure to read any warranties or guarantees they offer. In the case of laser toner cartridges and compatible ink cartridges the warranty should be a yearlong. Companies which offer 30 or 90 day warranties on printer cartridges have not put in the hard work of making sure they have a quality product.

Good remanufactured and compatible [printer ink cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) print with the sharpness and brilliance you are used to, but can save an individual or businesses large amounts of money.

And, there is simply the convenience factor too. There are many things that people do not like to buy online - guitars, shoes, boats, TV'sâ€¦

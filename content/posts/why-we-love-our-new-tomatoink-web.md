Sometimes change can be a good thing, and we believe we've done just that with our new web design. Over a course of 6 months, our team worked hard to roll out a revamped TomatoInk. Delivering the best online shopping experience for you, our customers, has always been one of our top goals. We believe this redesign this is another step toward this. It is more modern, responsive, and customer-friendly for you guys to [harvest the savings](https://www.tomatoink.com/) with us! Just take a look below.

#### Freshly Squeezed Ink, Fresh Web Design

Just like a tomato that's richly vibrant and healthy, our new website design is fresh and bright to reflect our eco friendly printer ink.

#### Senior-Friendly Website Design

A majority of our fellow TomatoInk shoppers fall into the senior age group, and we wanted to make our site more user-friendly for them.We did this by making buttons bigger as well bringing focus to helpful tools like the "Search for Ink" or "Ink Search" boxes that help you find your compatible ink cartridges by printer model.

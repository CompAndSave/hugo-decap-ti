First, let's start by getting real. No kid wants to think about Halloween as a time to be healthy. So let's just keep this healthier Halloween business between us, shall we?

For some parents, Halloween has gotten a little out of hand since they were kids. Those who used to come home with a few handfuls of Halloween candy are now seen lugging their kids' loaded pillowcases home, and then watching their children unload mountains of sugar into slightly smaller mounds by candy preference.

What is a parent who doesn't want his or her child to consume a truckload worth of candy to do? Here are a few ideas that may help.

## Tricks and Tips for a Healthier Halloween

### Purchase GMO-Free Snacks and Candy

If you can find [organic](https://www.rodalesorganiclife.com/food/organic-halloween-candy), that's even better. Simply look for the organic or GMO-free certified labels, or click here for suggestions.

### Bob for (Organic) Apples

It's an age-old Halloween party activity, but it's healthy too. Well, it is when you purchase organic apples! If you want to get really wild, both green and red organic apples will mix things up.

### Get Creative

* Draw scary faces on cheese stick wrappers or the outer peel of clementine oranges.
* Cut a banana in half. Put three chocolate chips in it. Use two for the eyes and one for a nose, so that it looks like a ghost. You could even put them on lollipop sticks.
* Put pretzel sticks in a clear plastic bag and tie it with a string. Through the middle of the bag place a pencil, so that it looks like a broomstick.
* Make fruit skewers and stick them into a pumpkin.
* Use Halloween shaped cookie cutters on cantaloupe, watermelon, and honeydew.

### Make Them Work for It!

While that Halloween candy is still in the house, let your kids know that they can eat the candy if they exercise. You can make it more fun by giving them certain exercises to do based on their age, such as 30 jumping jacks for a lollipop.

### Donate Extra Candy

Often you can find local donation centers that collect extra candy and send it to the troops. This is a great way to teach kids about paying it forward while getting rid of that excess candy. If there are no centers near you collecting candy, why not put together a basket and bring it to your local police station or fire department? You could even bake the chocolate into cookies or blondies, and bring them to the fine folks who keep your town safe!

## Beware of Food Allergies

By the way, another great way to help out this Halloween is to remember kids with food allergies. Every child should be able to experience the joy and tradition of trick-or-treating on Halloween. Yet kids with food allergies are often left out of the fun since most candy is off limits to them. The Teal Pumpkin ProjectÂ® is an easy and simple way to help these children have a fun-filled Halloween. All you have to do is have a non-food treat (such as pencils, stickers, glow sticks, and more) available as an alternative to candy.

Remember, we're keeping this healthier Halloween business between us. Otherwise who knows how many witches and goblins would come out at night!

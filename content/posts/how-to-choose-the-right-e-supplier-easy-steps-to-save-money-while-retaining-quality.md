**Why Finding the Right Supplier Is Important**There are hundreds of places online to buy ink, and today it is more important than ever to save money where and when you can. But in the effort to save money you do not want to sacrifice the quality to which you are accustomed with the OEM cartridges that your printer came with.Where you get your ink cartridges from can be the difference between getting a inkjet printer cartridge or laser toner cartridge that performs as well as the original equipment or one that simply does not do the job, but there are some things to look for before you click the 'pay' button on your browser. Reliable ink cartridge dealers will have a long track record to judge them by - if a company has not been in business at least five years that is an indicator that they simply do not have the track record which proves they deliver a quality product. 

E-commerce has made things easier than ever for people shopping for a variety of products, but this is especially true of ink and [toner cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/). However, a poorly designed site is an excellent thing to watch out for - if a company cannot take the time and care to make sure their website is well put together and easy to navigate, chances are they do not take any more care in the manufacture of the ink and toner cartridges they sell.

The site should be easy to navigate and the product that you need easy to find. Another thing to look for will be whether there are different avenues to search for the exact product that you need, and whether the company is based in the US. If they are shipping from another country that is a big indicator that their product is not as desirable.

The warranty should also be easy to understand and spelled out in clear terms, and since some people do not print very much material it should be longer then just a few months - if they do not offer at least a six month warranty, it is a sign that they know their cartridges are just not up to snuff. A year warranty is a good sign that the company knows their products will perform as advertised and are willing to stand behind them.

**A Great Supplier Supplies Great Customer Service**

One of the other main things to look for is how fast the company ships the product and how well they do in keeping you notified of that. In most instances, your product should ship within 24 hours. The quality of the customer service is also very important - are they easy to get ahold of, and can they answer all your questions? Do they have the exact cartridge that you need, or do they seem to only carry a few brands? They should also offer clear instructions and tips on installing your cartridges and getting the most out of them. If it is a barebones website with lax customer service and no knowledge base or troubleshooting tips, that is a clear indicator that you should go elsewhere in your search for high quality, low cost ink cartridges.

You can save big money and retain high quality on cartridges like the remanufactured replacement cartridges for the Epson S020089 Color Ink Cartridge - T052, and a good company will go oput of its way to make sure these cartridges are thoroughly cleaned, especially the inkjet nozzles, and that the inks are formulated to be as good as the manufacturers ink.

In the world of printing, the consumer has better equipment than ever available - modern printers will print crisp, clear black and white text and images, and the ability of small, inexpensive printers to deliver astounding color images and photos is almost impossible to believe when comparing them to products available to consumers as little as ten years ago.The problem with buying OEM print accessories such as [toner cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) and inkjet supplies is that this is where the major printer companies have decided to make most of their profit as it is the one thing they know you will have to keep buying again and again.

Fortunately for the modern consumer, there is an easy way to save big money on such items. Modern manufacturing and quality control techniques allow makers of compatible and remanufactured ink and toner cartridges to put out a product which is every bit as good as the OEM products available from the manufacturer of your printer, but this is not an easy task.

**GOOD MANUFACTURING AND QUALITY CONTROL ALWAYS SHINES THROUGH**

The first and most important component is the ink itself. It is possible to make these formulations to be indistinguishable from the OEM inks, but it takes a lot of effort. Good companies know this, and they don't skimp in this department. If the ink itself is substandard, the final product will be unacceptable.

Just as important though is the casing which the ink comes in - what good is it to have an ink which is the same as the OEM ink if the cartridge and print head have been poorly manufactured? There are two aspects to this, and the first comes down to a simple fit.

When you get a compatible or remanufactured product, the cartridge should have the exact dimensions and specs as the cartridges which originally came with your printer, and they should snap into the printer just as easily as an OEM cartridge. That is the first thing.

The second is the print head and nozzles on these cartridges, and that is an even bigger task than the dimensions and quality of the cartridge itself. Modern nozzles and print heads are what makes the new printers so good at delivering crisp, color photo printing. Obviously, companies who are just in this industry for a quick buck will skimp on all these areas, from the ink to the cartridge to the print heads and nozzles, and they will purposely avoid talking about their quality control measures and the grade of their manufacturing facilities.

**INDICATORS OF A POORLY RUN COMPANY**

If this area seems to be glossed over on a company's website it is a good sign that they know they are using substandard materials and inks, and their warranties and quality guarantees will reflect this - watch out for short or nonexistent warranties, or warranty plans which are hard to activate. Good companies will have an easy warranty system with a long warranty. Six months is good, but it is best to try to find a supplier that gives a year's warranty with a 100% satisfaction guarantee.

You can save big money over the life of your printer, and get results which are as good as the original cartridges gave you - buy carefully, and once you find a good supplier of remanufactured and compatible ink and laser toner cartridges, keep giving them your hard earned business!

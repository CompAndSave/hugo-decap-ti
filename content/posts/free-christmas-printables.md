Like our [Thanksgiving Themed Table Mats](https://www.tomatoink.com/blog/posts/printable-placemats-and-turkey-origami-for-thanksgiving.html) and [Halloween Themed Printables](https://www.tomatoink.com/blog/posts/free-spooky-printables-for-halloween.html), free printable décor items are perfect for the holidays and a great way to spend some quality time with your family. You can use the printable Christmas tree ornaments, paper cut out ornaments, cute animal cutouts, and gift tags and labels to decorate your home and gifts.

There are two versions of each ornament: the first is the colored version and the second consists of outline drawings that can be colored in—this really gets kids into the festive spirit and coloring is a fun activity any time!

## Here's what you will need for your free Christmas printables:

* A printer (ensure that the [ink cartridge](https://www.tomatoink.com/) has sufficient amount of ink)
* Good quality card stock for printing
* Scissors (safety scissors are a good bet if kids are going to help)
* Crayons, poster colors, or other coloring material (if required)
* A hole puncher
* String / festive ribbons

## Follow these simple steps to get the printouts of the Christmas decorations:

1. Click on the décor item of your choice. This will open up a PDF page.
2. Print the page using high-quality paper.
3. Cut along the outer lines to get the proper ornament shape.
4. If you printed the outline image, you can now color it in.
5. Use a hole puncher to make a small hole where indicated.
6. Insert string through the hole and your Christmas ornament is ready!

Use these printable ornaments to add a Christmas feel to the entire home. You can hang them on your Christmas tree of course; hang them up on walls, doors, and windows; or even string them on the fireplace mantle.

## As for the gift tags and labels, you could use them in two ways:

* Simply use double-sided sticky tape to glue them on to gifts.
* Or use a hole puncher and insert decorative string or brightly colored ribbons to attach the labels to the gifts.

These gift labels will give your decorations a uniquely beautiful look no matter how you use them.

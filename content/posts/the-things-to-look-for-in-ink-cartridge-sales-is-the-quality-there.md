**Does The Quality Rival OEM Products?**

The first time you go to a brick and mortar store to buy ink cartridges for your new inkjet or laser printer you are probably going to suffer some sticker shock. The ink that you get for free when you buy most printers does not even have a black cartridge; that uses the color all the faster, and it is not unusual to spend more on the ink than you did on the printer.

Unless you think ahead, that is - there are big savings if you know where to look.

If you type compatible ink cartridges, [printer ink cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) or compatible ink cartridges into your search engine and you will find dozens and dozens of sellers.

The question is, how can you tell the good from the bad? Before you spend your money, there are some things that you can look for that will make choosing a retailer of ink cartridges and toner cartridges a lot easier.

One of the first things you want to pay attention to is the quality of the ink - is it as good as the OEM ink that you would normally pay a lot more for? If the inks they have for sale do not perform at least as well as OEM cartridges that you would buy from Wal-Mart, then they are inferior cartridges.

With modern manufacturing and the proper process and quality control in place, getting a remanufactured ink cartridge or compatible ink jet cartridge that is as good as the OEM cartridge is possible. The same factory should be tasked with both remanufacturing old cartridges and in building new compatible cartridges that are, for all intents and purposes the same as the manufacturers original equipment.

**Finding the Best Seller**

For a business to be successful, especially an online retailer some things are extremely important. The warranty is very important, and should be easy to understand and put into action if something happens. All warranties should be at least six months to a year, and the terms and conditions should be spelled out in plain language.

The website should be set up in a simple fashion - when it comes to ordering ink you don't need a lot of distractions. You do want areas that hold general relevant information, but the main goal of the website should be to get the people quickly to the specific product they need. If they can get there through multiple lines of enquiry it will be a much easier site to use.

Another thing to look for is the range of products the etailer has available, how long they have been in business and any customer reviews you can find, both on their website and off of it. Serious ink cartridge sellers will carry only ink and toner cartridges. The good online retailers have a huge selection of laser toner cartridges and compatible ink cartridges, among them ink and toner cartridges like the Canon i960 ink cartridges. If they do not have a large inventory, if they sell other things it is a sign that they have not invested enough in the demanding field of printer ink cartridges.

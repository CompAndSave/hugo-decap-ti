When many people purchase a printer for their network and connect it to the computers of their business, that's often the end of the situation as far as they're concerned. Really, there's no point in focusing on the connections themselves as long as everything is set up and working, right? This is frequently the case, but many small (and even larger) businesses aren't aware that there's actually a fairly large degree of software involved with linking a printer to a network and having it mesh efficiently with a number of different machines.

Since it was first introduced, networking has proven to be a powerful benefit for small businesses with significant printing needs. In fact, if the networks didn't exist, businesses would either need to purchase many more printers or do all of their printing from one machine...Neither of which is a particularly cost-effective solution, especially for smaller businesses. Network management, on the other hand, is actually one of the most important considerations for a printer that will be used at a business. For example, the security aspect. Owners most likely want to be sure that nobody can access the printer without authorization, which means the printer itself needs to know which machines are okay to accept information from and which aren't. The control aspect enters into this as well, with some managers indicating a desire to shut off access to the printer except when it's necessary to have it on as a way of preventing abuse.

The ability of printers to manage their networks efficiently has come to the forefront as a result of news that technology company Levi, Ray & Shoup (LRS) has purchased Capella Technologies, one of the industry's leaders in providing software for the management of networked printers. Capella Technologies has primarily focused on the small business aspect of networks, which is usually very different from other situations like home settings or, more importantly, large printers.Including the addition of the workforce from Capella Technologies, LRS now employs over six hundred people as part of its team on providing technology and consulting services to businesses around the world.

Capella focused on a very different market from what LRS did, but the merger of the two companies has created a larger, stronger one with a reach to more geographic areas and the ability to provide services that previously couldn't be offered. Where LRS focused on major corporations and businesses, Capella previously emphasized serving smaller businesses and educational areas. Sales terms were not disclosed, but LRS has indicated that they plan to continue Capella's previously established operations and, potentially, support them with new muscle.

Either way, the realm of printing will continue on with a larger, stronger company ready to oversee operations and help customers throughout the world solve their printing needs, get the [ink cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) necessary for operations, and improve their overall efficiency through an understanding of what each printer connected to a network is actually capable

We'll be keeping an eye out for interesting news of joint projects from the Capella team and the main body of LRS.[Subscribe to our monthly newsletter](https://www.tomatoink.com/welcome/subscribe) and enjoy our promotions for your printer.

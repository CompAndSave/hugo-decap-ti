**Retailers and Manufacturers Eating Cost Increases - For Now**

The ink world is going through a world shifting change right now, though from the perspective of the consumer there is not a lot really going on. The innovations now lead to better pictures and many other things, but the fact that everyone expects that actually takes away some of the power of what the designers and scientists that word for the printing and ink world are doing.

The simple raw material costs of doing business are rising steadily, and have for the major part of the last 3 to 4 years. Especially in 2011, the disparity grew to the point where it was an actual presence being felt by the manufacturers. For the most part, consumers never saw the price increase, but that will change as 2012 plays out and 2013 comes in. Further, there is no sign in the raw materials market that prices for anything will be coming down. Name brand retailers charge the highest premium for their inks, and will reflect the largest change in price as the increases work their way into the system. Fortunately for consumers, there are some good [compatible ink](https://www.tomatoink.com/) suppliers.

**Realizing Potential Savings**

At the same time, there are constant advances being made in both the printer and ink world, like Bordeaux, which has developed a water based latex ink. This ink would replace solvent based inks, which is both environmentally friendly and more sustainable as far as the raw materials goes. As these new formulations grow in market share, though, the materials that they are made from will inevitably rise in price as the products rise in market share. However, such price shifts should be on a much slower basis, especially when compared to products which are manufactured mostly from petrochemical products. As we all know, that raw resource can go through huge price shifts.

Another big advance in making printing both better and cheaper at the same time are the new nano inks coming online, which allow the ink to be stretched to its most effective. This method also has promises in solutions which are not water based. This last would have a much larger impact on commercial printing rather than consumer printing because of speed considerations, but one thing must be pointed out - all these systems are being developed for inkjet type systems, and as those systems are developed for commercial use many of them will be and already are permeating the consumer market.

With luck and ingenuity, the advances being made in cost and material reductions will outpace the increasing costs of raw materials at some point in the near future. As new manufacturing, ink formulations and other factors come into play, the ink and printer industry will try as hard as it can to mitigate the increase in raw materials costs. Until then, though, we may be stuck with slightly higher prices. It will be more important than ever to find good, reputable ink retailers that will save you big money.

Hotels are traditionally enormous contributors to climate change. All but the greenest hotels, that is. Fortunately, the trend is moving toward more sustainable business practices, as hotels try to meet consumer demand for eco-friendly travel options.

There are a variety of ways that hotels can substantially lower their carbon footprint by embarking on green initiatives. This includes everything from using recycled materials in construction to using organic cleaning supplies to initiating recycling, rainwater, and composting programs.

After doing quite a bit of extensive research, we've narrowed down the greenest hotels search to 15 destinations based on their commitment to environmentally friendly business and social practices. Let's hope even more hotels follow in their footsteps.

### Honorable Mention

We are also going to give a big honorable mention to [The King's Daughters Inn](https://thekingsdaughtersinn.com/), in Durham, North Carolina, which combined a need for preserving a historic building's architectural past with green building features and environmentally sound materials.

They use a cistern and a rain garden to collect roof storm water run-off and avoid using public water resources to maintain landscaping. The parking lot is made of pervious concrete so the ground absorbs rainwater into the ground.

# Low Carbon Footprint = Low Costs

Most hotels tend to use natural resources at an alarmingly high rate. By establishing green practices, they can lower electricity and water usage, which in turn is cost effective and helps the environment. Since the majority of travelers intend to make more environmentally friendly choices, hotels have the ability to substantially lower their carbon footprint while improving their own bottom line!

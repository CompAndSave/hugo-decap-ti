National Burger Day is coming up on May 28th. This year I wanted to pay homage to vegetarian and vegan burger options here on the blog. Now, before you make assumptions about how delicious veggie burgers could actually be, I suggest you take some time to make one (or more) of the recipes mentioned here. You'll be pleasantly surprised!

More and more people are turning to plant-based eating, and people who have never tried this way of eating make awful (and incorrect) judgements about their diets. Vegetarian and vegan food can be delicious, flavorful, and packed with nutrients. It's not all raw lettuce and boiled cabbage (yech), I assure you!

So in the spirit of that statement, what better way to convince you than by introducing you to some delicious veggie burgers this year?

# Top Six Veggie Burger Recipes

### 1\. Carnivore-Approved Mushroom Veggie Burger

I love mushrooms; they are juicy and meaty and make a great burger. [This](https://www.thespruce.com/mushroom-veggie-burger-recipe-102163) meaty mushroom burger packs "heft and spice", according to The Spruce. Taking a look at the recipe, I can see that it has oats, Parmesan, and 1 ½ pounds of a combination of mushrooms. I can well believe that this burger recipe is a keeper.

### 2\. Mixed Veg Burger

I love the various spices and flavorings that go into making [this](https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/veg-burger-recipe-veggie-burger/) vegetarian burger from Veg Recipes of India. I think a mixed vegetable burger with a spiced mayonnaise dressing sounds delicious! You can have a play-around with the spices and keep the ones that work for you, or you can make it as is if you're an adventurous and open-minded eater. Either way, this is one to try.

### 3\. BBQ Jackfruit Burgers with Apple Slaw

Vegan pulled pork? Say what? It's true, though. Vegans in the know have been using jackfruit (which is also a good source of fiber, vitamins A and C, and potassium, AND is rich in antioxidants) because the mild flavor of the fruit makes it an absolute dream to pair various flavors with, and when it's young the fruit "pulls" like pork. Check out Olive Magazine's [vegan burger](https://www.olivemagazine.com/recipes/vegan/bbq-jackfruit-buns-with-apple-slaw/) for a "super meaty, but sweet and fruity taste" — perfect meat-free comfort food.

### 4\. Chickpea and Sweetcorn Burger

If you choose to make Jamie Oliver's "healthy and seriously satisfying" [burgers](https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/vegetables-recipes/the-best-vegan-burger/), remember, you have to pat the chickpeas and sweetcorn dry once you get them out of the tins. Not patting them dry will lead to a wet mixture. If the dough is too wet, then you can add some breadcrumbs or flour to the mixture and that will thicken it right up again.

### 5\. Sunflower Veggie Burgers

[Tasty's](https://tasty.co/recipe/sunflower-veggie-burgers) sunflower veggie burgers use an entire cup of sunflower seeds in its creation, but I don't mind because I love sunflower seeds (and they are [seriously good](https://draxe.com/sunflower-seeds/) for you!). I love that the burger uses brown rice in its creation (so nutty and delicious); it sounds hearty and filling and delicious because it is.

### 6\. Carrot Tahini Quinoa Burgers with Tzatziki

With shredded rainbow carrots, tahini, and quinoa, all topped off with a nutty red cabbage slaw and creamy tzatziki, The Rhubarbarian's vegetarian burger [recipe](http://www.rhubarbarians.com/carrot-tahini-quinoa-burgers-with-tzatziki/) will grace any table any day of the week. I think it sounds like an absolute dream come true, although I think I might pretty much say that about any vegetarian or vegan burger.

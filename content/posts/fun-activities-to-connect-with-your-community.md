Fun Activities To Do

Social interaction and making strong bonds within the community are important not just to keep one engaged and amused. More and more research points to the importance of social interaction for increased mental health and wellbeing. For example, older people who have strong interpersonal relationships and friendships live longer. Studies found that socially active people have better immune systems and are less prone to illnesses than those who live isolated lives.

Take this simple example: grandparents who spend a lot of time with their grandkids will have more active lifestyles, will probably eat healthier meals and may even give up bad habits such as smoking. This has obvious positive impacts on physical wellbeing. As for the positive impact on emotional health; that's fairly obvious too!

## May is Older Americans Month

Each May is observed as Older Americans Month by the Administration for Community Living. In 1963, it was found that about a third of older Americans were living in poverty. It was decided that an entire month would be devoted to addressing the needs of this demographic and to acknowledging the contributions made by this group to the nation's defense and to society as a whole.

May 2015 is the 50th year of this observance and the theme this year is Get into the Act (previous themes have been Safe Today, Healthy Tomorrow and Unleash the Power of Age and so on). Programs involve raising awareness about the benefits of community living, increasing community involvement, promoting healthy aging and preventing elder abuse.

## Get into the act this Older Americans Month

There is much that you as an individual can do to get involved and engaged with your community. Sure you can take up bingo, but there are so many other simple ways to boost your physical and emotional wellbeing. These can actually help slow down the seemingly inexorable pace of aging:

## Enroll at a local gym

Several benefits here: better physical health, a fitter body, and regular interaction with others. Pick a time slot frequented by like-minded people you can relate to, so that a workout seems less like a chore and more like a daily fun activity. And it doesn't have to be a gym; you could join a cycling club or a trekking group that matches your skill and fitness level.

## Take a class

A craft class or an art class or perhaps that carpentry course you never found time for; learning a new language or a musical instrument or even doing a refresher driver's course… research shows that learning something new at an older age actually improves cognitive functioning.

## Experiment in the kitchen

There are so many free resources on the internet: free recipes for healthier meals, ways to dish up something delicious with less effort, special recipes for restricted diets and so on. Use these to create masterpieces in the kitchen; the family will be very appreciative of your efforts.
You can also learn to make preserves or perhaps learn more about canning or learn all about handmade chocolates. Perhaps you can turn that into a little cottage industry? A fun way to turn out small profit!

## Pamper yourself a little

How about a spa day with a friend? Or a wine and chocolate party! If that's really not your thing, how about an entire day devoted to golf or fishing with a good friend – splurge on a new kit or some advanced equipment and get more current in your chosen activity.

## Date night

Research also shows that couples in committed loving relationships live longer, healthier lives than singles. Invest some time and effort in your partner and make a date with her just as you used to so many years ago. A nice meal at a fine dining restaurant, going dancing or on a river cruise; where you concentrate on each other. She will feel special, and so will you!

## Take up gardening

Provided that your joints and lower back are in good health, gardening can be a great hobby to take up. It is therapeutic to grow things. And you can head to the garden center or nursery to get new plants, find tips and spend the time of day with likeminded people.

## Volunteer work

There are many worthy causes that need nothing more than your time. Few things in life are as satisfying and intrinsically rewarding as knowing that you have made a positive difference to the lives of others.

## Gallery openings, museums, art walks

And how about getting a little culture if you're so inclined? An art walk may reveal hidden treasures of your own city and the local museum may actually have much to offer and gallery openings may well awaken the latent artist in you!
If our readers have some ideas to contribute, we'd love to hear from you!

# Take an Eco-Friendly Approach to Halloween

Pumpkins, cinnamon sticks, burnt orange leaves, and trick-or-treatersâ€”these are just a few of the unmistakable smells and sights of fall. With Halloween fast approaching, let's track down inexpensive, eco-friendly alternatives to some of the traditional ways of celebrating All Hallows' Eve. And share below or on social media what your Halloween costume will be with the #GreenHalloween hashtag.

## Make Your Own Costume

We can't have a #GreenHalloween without mentioning these cheap, eco-friendly costumes: the Incredible Hulk and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. All you need for the Incredible Hulk costume is green body paint and torn purple pants. You can even create your own paint with cornstarch, food coloring, and honey or lotion. If you don't have old purple pants on hand, try dying purple a well-worn pair of light-colored pants. Follow these [step-by-step instructions](http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Costume) for making a homemade Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle costume.

Consider reusing old clothing or leftover material as a Halloween costume. [Butterick](https://butterick.mccall.com/patterns/costumes?page=all) and [Simplicity](http://www.simplicity.com/patterns/costumes/) offer sewing patterns for a range of costumes and age groups. Go sci-fi with a Star Trek costume or back in time with steampunk.

## Shop for Used Items

If you're not handy with a sewing machine, then stop by a thrift or used clothing store. These stores have such a varied selection of clothing that you're bound to find the start of a unique costume. Get a long pink dress and with a few rips and red dye or paint, you can be Carrie from Stephen King's novel.

Does your child still adore Elsa from _Frozen_? Then look for a [blue dress and shoes](http://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/10/13%5Fdiy%5Fhalloween%5Fcostumes%5Ffor.html) as well as a sheer curtain for the cape. You can also make the wand using an ornamental star, wooden dowel, and ribbon. Take it a step or two further to create a wand like Harry Potter's.

## Host a Costume Swap

Why not exchange costumes from previous Halloweens with local friends and family? Make it a yearly tradition among the adults, kids, and teenagers in your neighborhood. You'll all save money and be kind to the environment.

To host the party, follow these simple tips:

* Separate the adults' and children's costumes in two sections or rooms to keep the clothing and accessories organized.
* Lay out the ground rules. Let everyone know ahead of time whether it's first-come, first-served.
* Decorate with touches of autumn, including pumpkins. You can then use those pumpkins later to carve jack-o'-lanterns.
* Serve festive, in-season food, such as pumpkin spice cookies, a fruit salad of apples and pears, or baked sweet potato fries.

## Craft a Bag

If your child doesn't reuse the same Halloween bag each year, repurpose an [old pillowcase](http://archive.boston.com/lifestyle/specials/halloween/costumemaking?pg=3) by decorating it with reflective tape and fabric paint. You can do this each year using the same pillowcase or a sturdy, plain reusable bag.

Another option is to buy a low-cost, environmentally friendly premade bag that your child can use again. Pick up this double-stitched, hand-painted Halloween [bag](http://www.nectar-of-life.com/Halloween-Bags%5Fc%5F32.html) made from the jute sacks of organic Fair Trade coffee.

These days, money is tighter than ever and it is more important to save money where you can; it seems as though everything is getting more expensive, from gas to food to electricity. One exception to that is electronics, which continues to see declines in everything from computers and TVs to printers. One area where that does not hold true in electronics is on accessories, such as cables or on ink supplies.The internet offers a great place to save money on certain items, and those accessories are an excellent place to save. Ink cartridges and [toner cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) are almost custom made items in which it is possible to save large amounts of money without sacrificing quality, but there are a few things to keep in mind when purchasing from an online supplier.

Harvest Savings with TomatoInk

The first thing is to make sure you are dealing with a reputable company, and once you find a good company it is always best to give them your repeat business; online retailers are no different than brick and mortar stores in that regard. A company should earn your business by delivering a good product in a timely fashion, and good customer service is a must.

**ONLINE OR IN A BRICK AND MORTAR STORE, QUALITY ALWAYS TELLS**

Just as with businesses that you can drive to, there are many businesses online that do not make it a high priority to do that; bad products, shoddy customer service and a fly by night attitude will ensure that any business does not stay in business, but that won't help once you have purchased something from them.

Compatible ink and printer ink cartridge retailers have to deal with this all the time, but there are companies out there who deliver products which are as good as OEM products but which can provide tremendous savings. The good companies will go out of their way to prove that they can and do deserve your trust.

Customer service is one of the big things to be one the lookout for, as this is the number one area where shoddy retailers always seem to skimp on - it is almost part of their business model, and that is by design as it discourages unsatisfied customers from getting refunds on faulty products which were put together cheaply.

A good e-tailer will have several levels of customer service options; these will include email, but should also include toll free numbers and perhaps live chat. These last two are the important ones - it is easy to set up an auto reply system for emails, but it is not so easy to supply live customer service when you are not interested in actually delivering a good product.

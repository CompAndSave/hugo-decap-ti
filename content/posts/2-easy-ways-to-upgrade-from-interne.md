Internet Explorer 8 (Image from Online.Care1st.com)

Starting Month XX, 2015 we will no longer be supporting Internet Explorer 8 on TomatoInk.com in order to better serve the overall TomatoInk community. What this means for users who continue to use Internet Explorer 8 after XXXX, is that some pages may seem "disoriented" or incorrectly aligned. As a result, we urge our visitors to upgrade their Internet Explorer Version to ensure a smooth shopping experience for freshly squeezed ink. Another option would be to switch to another web browser such as Firefox or Chrome.

If you need help with upgrading or switching your current web browser, please read the directions below for a smoother TomatoInk shopping experience.

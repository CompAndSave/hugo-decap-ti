Hewlett-Packard, one of the biggest names in printing, recently took the mystery away from its newest line of products and set about announcing all that it could do. The Officejet Pro X line is the highlight of these new items, with a host of innovations that help to make it a good choice for many businesses.In its standard office printing mode, the Officejet Pro X is capable of printing as many as seventy high-quality pages per minute, or faster than one page per second, which ranks it among the fastest and most efficient desktop printers anywhere in the market. This is particularly valuable for any businesses that have a lot of rush jobs (for example, needing to deliver something to customers or patients) or who simply do a lot of [printing ](https://www.tomatoink.com/)and don't want employees to be standing around for ten or fifteen minutes, waiting to get something so they can return to work.

However, the speed of a printer doesn't really matter much if the ink cartridge can't keep up. This was taken into consideration early in the design process, and the end result was the line of HP 970 and 971 inkjet cartridges. These two versions feature pigments that are not only long-lasting, but extremely quick to dry as well. When you're printing at the Officejet Pro X's best speed, the rate at which the ink dries really is a major consideration. It's always nice to see that cartridge technology is keeping pace with the power of the printers themselves.

Color printing is often lauded for the things you can do with it, but in the business world, not everyone needs to have anything more than black and white. This is especially true for any location that has more than one printer, where most employees can take advantage of the general use printers while reserving the color printer for later. HP is now offering the 3610 and 3620 lines of Black & White printers, with outstanding results in 12,000 printed pages when paired with appropriately compatible cartridges. The newer ink cartridges are designed to produce a laser-like look while adding in durability and longevity, along with considerably less electricity usage for creating similar results. Electric bills may not be considered a major factor in highly developed regions, especially for larger companies, but they can be invaluable for businesses working to make their mark in newer markets where electricity might be significantly more expensive and every [bit of savings](https://www.tomatoink.com/) makes a real difference in their bottom line.

By expanding into more markets, HP (and other printer producers) have the opportunity to increase sales. With increased sales come greater profits that, in turn, allow for more research and development on how to make printers continually more affordable and more efficient at what they do. With the right responses to this situation, HP is in a position to make some fairly significant gains within the industry. Of course, only time will be able to tell the full impact of this new line of printers…

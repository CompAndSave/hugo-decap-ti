A new year is upon us and, for many, that means resolutions to become healthier, happier, and even greener in our everyday living. Eating more healthy foods is a [top three](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/common-new-years-resolutions-stick/) "new year, new you" goal. It is no secret, however, that eating fresh foods in the winter time can be a challenge, especially winter fruits and vegetables. But isn't taking on new challenges what New Year's resolutions are all about?

If you find yourself reaching for the same old fruits and veggies at the grocery store every week, you are not alone. In the United States, [only 12 percent](https://www.today.com/series/one-small-thing/americans-don-t-eat-enough-fruits-vegetables-cdc-finds-t118925) of people actually eat the recommended 1.5-2 cups of fruits each day and only 9 percent eat the advised 2-3 cups of veggies. Eating the same produce over and over again? It's no wonder those numbers are so dismal — how boring! Break out of your usual mealtime routine and try something new this year. Here are some seasonal fruits and veggies worth featuring in your family meals.

## 40 Recipes Using Winter Fruits and Vegetables

### Beets

These ruby red root veggies are packed with healthful vitamins (think potassium, Vitamin C, and magnesium). They are best enjoyed when roasted but can also be thinly sliced and enjoyed raw, pickled, or shredded into a slaw.

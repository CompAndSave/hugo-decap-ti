TomatoInk Brother LC61 Combo Pack

When many people think of [combo packs](https://www.tomatoink.com/nsearch/?Submit=Search&limit=16&p=3&q=pack) in relation to ink, they often think of the three basic colors along with a pack of black that can be used to totally replace the current cartridges within the machine. This does make sense, particularly since cartridges will often run out relatively close to one another (except black, which often goes faster), and a pack that can replace everything within the printer can be very convenient. However, there are actually a variety of other combo packs available that you can choose from. Let's take a look at some of them.

In general, there are two major types of [combo packs](https://www.tomatoink.com/nsearch/?Submit=Search&limit=16&p=4&q=pack): those with a selection of the same cartridge, and those with unusual numbers of different cartridges. Starting with the first, multiple copies of the same cartridge is a great way to buy ink in bulk for your home or business. Mostly business, really, because the average home probably doesn't need to buy ink in five or ten cartridge packs. For businesses, purchasing a bulk combo pack is a great way to restock on ink before it runs out, but often times, the other type of combo pack is even more useful.

After all, since black is usually printed more often than colors, doesn't it make sense to sell packs that have additional cartridges of black? This tends to offer the best value for businesses by helping to focus on not constantly needing to make separate orders to restock on black while only occasionally getting a combo pack. Most of these combo packs come in one of three varieties for you to choose from.

The first is the three-to-one ratio, which has three times as many black cartridges as color ones. While actually a little unusual and only offered for select models (unless cartridges are being ordered individually, in which case the ratio is whatever you want it to be), this is a setup that focuses on businesses that do print in color, but not nearly as often as they print in black-and-white.

The three-to-two ratio is more common and rather more popular, suiting businesses that only print a little more in black than they do in color and happen to need an extra push in order to really get things in the proper ordering ratio.

Finally, the two-to-one pack is a less extreme version of the three-to-one, and rather more common, since it provides significantly more black than color but still gives the added value of a combo pack and bulk orders.

As you can see from all of the things listed here, combo packs can actually be a very interesting option for the home or business that wants to buy [ink cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) more effectively. Available combo packs can vary significantly by brand, so if you're interested in purchasing any for your business, carefully look through the catalog to see if packs are available for your choices. You might be surprised at just how much you can save when you buy your ink efficiently.

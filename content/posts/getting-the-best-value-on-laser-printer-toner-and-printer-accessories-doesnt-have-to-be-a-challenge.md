Laser printers are often a great investment for small and large businesses alike and can provide a long life of service in most business environments. Like any often-used office machine, there will always come a time when bits need replacing or parts wear out. Luckily, you are not restricted to high cost replacement parts from the original manufacturers; there are great manufacturers out there offering quality parts at a fraction of the price. Be sure and do your homework when it comes to online retailers, and shop from a long established and reputable dealer.

The most common thing you'll need to replace for a laser printer is toner. Toner powder is equivalent to ink in an inkjet printer and is used every time you print something. The more high-volume your printing needs are, the more often you can expect to replace toner. This regular expense can really add up over the lifetime of your printer, but there are ways to cut your costs without cutting quality. Instead of buying direct from the manufacturer and paying high markups you can shop through a company that has recycled old, [empty toner cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/), tested their parts, and refilled them with new toner powder, making them as good as new. Not only are these cartridges offered as much as 50% less than from the original manufacturer, you, and your company, can feel great about the positive environmental impact you are having on the planet by recycling these cartridges.

Another common issue for printers is failing connection cables. Though this is not necessarily a regular occurrence, it can become an issue quickly if print jobs cannot be sent to the printer. Sometimes the cables included with your purchase simply are not long enough to allow you to place your machine in the most convenient location for you, other times, you may receive faulty cables, or the cable may simply fail at some point during its life cycle. Regardless of the reason, it is likely that at some point you will need to replace these vital cables. When purchasing direct from the manufacturers you can expect to pay as much as $20 or more for a single cable! But if you are a smart shopper, it is easy to find a great deal on [quality cables online](https://www.tomatoink.com/usb-printer-cables). Companies like [TomatoInk ](https://www.tomatoink.com/)sell a wide variety of printer connection cables in various lengths starting as low as $0.99!

Your laser printer will likely last you a very long time, especially if you keep up with regular maintenance and change the toner cartridges as soon as they become empty. By being a smart, savvy shopper, and finding a great online resource like TomatoInk for your [toner replacement cartridge](https://www.tomatoink.com/nsearch/?q=toner&Submit=Search) and printer cable needs, you can expect to save a significant amount of money over the life of your office printer. There is no need to be pushed around by the big name manufacturers who want you to believe they are the only source for high-quality printer parts. You now have the knowledge to make sure your office printer is up and running for the lowest cost, with the highest quality parts available!

**St. Patrick's Day (17th March**) is just around the corner, and many of us are looking to celebrate this holiday in our own unique ways. Seeing how popular our [printables series of blog posts](https://www.tomatoink.com/blog/?s=printables) have become recently, we decided to celebrate this observance in a similar fashion – with a set of colorable printables for kids.

St. Patrick's Day is widely celebrated all over the country and you can join in the festivities too. Our colorable printables for St. Patrick's Day can be a simple and effective way to help children become more culturally aware and involved.

Apart from the parade and the feasting, it makes sense to take a moment to know more about the symbolism and the significance of the holiday. Take a look at the various St. Patrick's Day related motifs we have put together and print them out.

**Here's what you will need and what you have to do:**

* Good quality printing paper
* A printer (any kind of printer will do – black & white or color; inkjet or laser – since you will be printing out only outlines here; but do make sure that the [ink cartridge](https://www.tomatoink.com/) is not exhausted)
* A set of water colors, poster colors, crayons, sketch pens, markers, paint, etc.
* Some glitter, ribbons or other decorative materials (optional)
* Binder or frames

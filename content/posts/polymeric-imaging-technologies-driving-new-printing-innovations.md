## Little Seen Company Responsible For Huge Steps Forward

In the world of ink development, sometimes the most important players are not even companies that make ink cartridges. They are worth paying attention to, however, because what they are working on this year will be the next gigantic leap forward in print technology next year. There is a direct line between research of this type and the laser toner cartridges and [ink cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) that you will be buying for your printer.

One company like this is Polymeric Imaging, a high tech firm which already holds eight patents in ink technology. In 2007, they released the first digital UV vacuum formable ink in the world. This high performance digital ink has over an 800% elongation capability and adheres to a wide range of materials.

Substrates for this ink system include acrylic, PETG, polyethylene materials (commonly used for banners) and many more. This has many advantages, but in the physical applications field it is hard to overestimate how important this is. The conformability to corrugations and rivets makes it the perfect choice for vehicle wrap.

## Commercial Technology Becoming Home Oriented

More and more desktop printers can print an array of materials, and this will only increase as time goes on. Ink formulations like the one above and other variations of that, both by Polymeric Imaging and other specialty design houses will see wider and wider use as these technologies are adapted by the consumer fulfilling special need or opening micro businesses. I know one person who prints on an acrylic material for covering bag toss boards (corn hole boards). He carries the printer around in his car, and he is already preparing for these inks to hit a wider market.

That is the true revolution that is coming in printers and printer ink cartridges as well as toner cartridges and laser toner cartridges; processes which were once ruled by industry because of cost, just like color printers, are being constantly scaled down in size and cost by the march of technology itself. Other industries are like this as well (the recording industry is a good example of this), but the printing industry seems to be particularly adept at making affordable what once only large companies could afford.

Those days are going, and the new technologies will soon see a wider and wider consumer application, from printing fine art to printing your own child's tee shirts for school, and having them look as good as any screen printing you have ever seen. These advanced printing technologies are coming down the pike, and for every new printer there will be intense competition over who sells the printer cartridges for the model printer that you end up with. Fortunately for consumers, compatible ink manufacturers and companies who make remanufactured cartridges are never far behind once a printer reaches the consumer market. The good companies are extremely adept at picking up new technologies and turning out cartridges as good as the OEM cartridges.

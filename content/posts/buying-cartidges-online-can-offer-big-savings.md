Let's face it, if you don't print very often, then the price doesn't matter all that much as long as the final product is relatively decent. If you're running any sort of company that deals with a lot of [ink and toner](https://www.tomatoink.com/) usage, though, even a small change in the price can lead to pretty significant savings (or costs) over time. With that in mind, why is it that buying online might be able to save you money?

There are several reasons why it matters, but perhaps the most significant is the fact that online companies can often buy in bulk. Retail stores often have difficulties with this because of their warehousing and storage concerns. In a retail store, shelf space is important, and each store can only hold so many of a particular product. Many have warehouses where products can be shipped to many different stores, but these warehouses are themselves limited and tend to be occupied by other products as well.

Online stores that focus on direct sales are able to completely avoid the issues of storage and shelf space, dedicating a larger section of warehouses to holding the necessary products. It's become financially feasible to stock large numbers of many different printer products, and these bulk purchases give the negotiating power to arrange for better deals on each product. With better deals comes the ability to offer customers lower prices and not worry about details like paying rent on a retail store, hiring employees to be out on the floor, or many other costs associated with traditional sales outlets.

The online savings of buying from the manufacturer in bulk also allow for savings when the ink is being sold in bulk. Customers who have reason to purchase and use truly gargantuan quantities of ink (such as schools, military services, hospitals, and others) are often eligible for additional discounts that they probably wouldn't be able to get from a traditional retail outlet. This may even include special priority for customer service and faster resolution of any problems that may occur.

Top Deals on Ink and Toner at TomatoInk

TomatoInk in particular is able to offer [printer ink cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) from the original manufacturers, but often without the brand name attached.

However, our manufacturers product cartridges to the exact same quality standards at all times; the lack of reselling through a brand name, however, allows the avoidance of otherwise significant costs. In addition to these cartridges, however, TomatoInk also offers a variety of brand-name cartridges and excellent prices for customers who are more comfortable using what they're already familiar with. Both choices are safe and effective, as long as the parts themselves are compatible with the printer being used. All ink cartridges from TomatoInk, including wholesale items and third-party cartridges, are backed by a complete money-back guarantee for one year so that customers can rest easy about the security of their purchases.

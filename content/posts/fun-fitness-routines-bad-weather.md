I have a confession to make: I HATE working out.

Don't get me wrong, I work out anyway. And I'm mildly addicted to the post-workout buzz because that part of it is *great*. I suffer from depression, and it truly helps my mood when I do work out; I couldn't replicate the high if I tried. Having said that, though, if I could figure out a way to get to the buzz without actually doing the workout, I'd do it. But like most things in life, if you want to get to point B (point Buzz) you have to actually make it from point A to point Buzz, and sometimes that involves what it involves (typically a run, in my case, or yoga, if I'm feeling the need for a gentler workout).

If you're anything like me, then any old excuse will do to skip your workout. The weather — which can be foul during winter months when you live in a temperate climate — is one of the best excuses there is! But sadly, that excuse is no longer viable. I'm here to pop your balloon, deflate your whoopee, and be a general spoilsport.

## Fun Fitness Routines You Can Do No Matter What the Weather

## Yoga

Yoga is one of the best indoor exercises there is. In the past (as in, in the days before follow-along videos), people did yoga by either memorizing the various ashanas (this happens naturally as you make it a routine, by the way), or by following the routines in books and/or pamphlets. (Yoga studios are great too, but this piece is all about getting your fitness routine on at home!) But now there are a whole host of amazing tutorials and follow-along videos out there, and there are some truly talented people who respectfully impart their knowledge of yoga (and meditation).

When I was researching this piece, I asked my friends for their recommendations for their favorite internet yogi. An overwhelming number of them recommended Jessamyn Stanley, a plus-sized yoga instructor who is changing the way yoga bodies are thought of. She has some free videos [online](http://jessamynstanley.com/), and she is worth checking out.

Rodney Yee is also a yoga instructor of note, and he has clearly figured out life because he seems to spend most of his time doing yoga by the sea or in the mountains. For his incredible videos, and to learn more about him, visit his site here.

Other yoga teachers of note are [Faith Hunter](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpVAQxfvnKUN-bYXpmjXJtA) and [Nazaahah Amin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8zivmHZZUTwbAFwsSdOeJA).

## Dance

Dance is one of the most fun ways you can exercise, and what can be better than Bollywood dance? While it's true that Bollywood actors and actresses make their dance routines look effortless, it actually requires a great deal of core body strength and fitness. So while dancing is fun, it is also rigorous enough to be considered a serious workout. It's one you could definitely pursue, no matter what the weather.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXMXUjX5wCM) is a really good workout to consider adding to your fitness repertoire, as is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj9d6aBOzDo) one.

Another excellent way to get a dance workout in is with Dance Dance Revolution (DDR). You can download the open-source game with Stepmania [here](https://www.stepmania.com/download/), and use [these](https://www.amazon.com/D-Force-Nonslip-USB-Dance-Pad/dp/B00HBUJ0N0) non-slip USB dance pads that can be used with a computer.

## Wii Fit

Wii Fit is a great tool to get your workout routine in. It "combines fun and fitness in one product," according to its [website](http://wiifit.com/). Don't discount this product because these games will make you stand up and move. Some of my favorite Wii Fit games leave me sore and tired with aching muscles, a racing heart, and drenched in sweat, but most importantly, with that all-important post-workout buzz we talked about earlier.

My personal recommendations are:

* [Dance Dance Revolution: Hottest Party](https://www.amazon.com/DanceDanceRevolution-II-Bundle-Nintendo-Wii/dp/B0050SVFWE%3Fpsc%3D1%26SubscriptionId%3DAKIAIH6BKLR7M6KSMDGQ%26tag%3Daboutcom02nintendo-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0050SVFWE?th=1) (1, 2, and 3) This is another DDR game, but the footwork is fast and keeps you on your toes.
* [Active Life: Outdoor Challenge](https://www.amazon.com/Active-Life-Outdoor-Challenge-Nintendo-Wii/dp/B0013LTP5Q%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIH6BKLR7M6KSMDGQ%26tag%3Daboutcom02nintendo-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0013LTP5Q) This collection of energetic mini-games that will have you running, tilting, jumping, and flapping your arms until you've melted into a puddle.
* [Punch-Out!](https://www.amazon.com/Punch-Out-Nintendo-Wii/dp/B001TOQ8K2/) You want to make sure you use the balance board to get the full body workout experience.

I hope these fun fitness routines have helped you in some way. And I hope I've inspired you to try something new for your next workout! Have a great time chasing that post-workout buzz!

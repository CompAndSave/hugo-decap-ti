[![3d printing medicine ](/blog/images/archive/2015/05/ti_3d_300x250_052015.jpg)](/blog/images/archive/2015/05/ti%5F3d%5F300x250%5F052015.jpg)We pay tribute to our war heroes this Memorial Day, May 25th this year – we remember not just those who gave up their lives in battle but also our veterans and active duty soldiers who lost a limb or received other disfiguring injuries while on active duty. Today we look at how 3D printing is transforming the medical world among others; how it is giving soldiers fresh hope for living a full life once again; a life unhampered by handicaps or disfigurement.  
3D printers are actually able to ‘print' customized prosthetic limbs, jaws, and other body parts to effectively replace damaged or amputated ones. We look at some of the amazing things 3D printing is making possible in the world of medicine right now:

**Robotic arm with opposable thumb**

Sydney was just six when she lost her arm below the elbow in a boating accident. She is now 13 and has tried out several prosthetic arms over the years. Now however, engineering students at Washington University in St. Louis through a partnership with Shriners Hospital made her a 3D printed robotic arm – pink at her request. While a typical robotic limb would cost between $50,000 and $70,000, this one cost about $200!

**3D printed ears**

Tai is a four year old who was born with the rare condition without an ear and an ear canal. The problems of going to school with only one ear were obvious. However Paul Tanner, anaplastologist had a solution: a prosthetic ear. Using the existing ear as a model, a prosthetic was created – a 3d printed, customized, fit-to-stay ear!

**3D printed skull**

3D printing technology was used to perform a skull transplant by a team of experts at the University Medical Center in Utrecht. A 22 year old woman had a rare, life threatening condition that caused the thickening of her bones, including skull bones. This was impairing her eyesight, and hindering motor coordination. Similarly, a Chinese farmer received a 3D-printed titanium mesh custom made for him by surgeons at Xijing Hospital, to repair the left side of his skull, which had been crushed in an accident.

**3D printed skin, organs, heart valves, bone**

And then there is the 3D printing of live tissue - high-end tissue fabrication with the help of Bio-bots using cartridge technology that isn't all that different to inkjet printers.

  
Harvard University researchers are working on bio-printing blood vessels. Models of cancerous tumors are 3D printed to improve outcomes and reduce surgery times. In Cornell University, a 3D printed heart valve will soon be tested in sheep. 3D printed synthetic skin and organs – there is this and more in the pipeline.

**How 3D printing is helping soldiers and war veterans**

Soldiers with faces wounded in IED blasts can have their faces significantly restored by doctors at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. For injured soldiers, customized, perfectly fitting facial reconstructions are now possible.

The ‘Wounded Soldier Raptor' is a prosthetic hand designed for soldiers wounded in the line of duty. Independence, a restoration of feelings such as pride and self worth – all these can be made possible for soldiers.

Taylor was a victim of an IED blast; a quadruple amputee who lost all four of his limbs. He recently became the first to wear a 3D printed bionic arm. Developed by his friend Neal, an engineer from Iowa, the technology is rudimentary still, but has tremendous potential.

3-D print super-lightweight prosthetic legs with stealth styling, is the vision of William Root, from the Pratt Institute in New York City. The ‘Exo', a black prosthetic made from sintered titanium powder or high-strength plastic would cost a fraction of traditional prosthetics, making this accessible to many more people.

The type of technology that exists right now and that which undoubtedly will evolve from this, offers a invigorating hope for brave soldiers who have done their jobs only to suffer life altering injuries in the process. If you have any stories to share with us this Memorial Day, we would love to hear about them. Feel free to share in the comments below or via our Facebook page.

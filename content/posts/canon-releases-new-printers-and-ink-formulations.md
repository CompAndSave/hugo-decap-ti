**The Importance of Black - Deeper Black Means Better Photos**

Canon has been working to increase quality with new printers and ink formulations. These include the Pro9000 Mark II and Pro9500 Mark II; these are designed along the same lines as the Pixma Pro-1, one of their higher end photo printers. In the inks area, the new printers use the new Lucia pigment inks which is supplemented with the Chroma Optimizer which makes a strong difference in the quality of the way black ink prints to glossy paper. This, of course, will be very useful in the area of photo and art printings, which are the number one uses for glossy paper.

One of the problems with glossy paper with many ink formulations is the gloss differential and bronzing which takes place with many ink formulations when used with high gloss photo paper. Canon has also reformulated the yellow ink, which should result in increased coverage in the red/magenta/yellow spectrum of the color gamut, giving pictures more brilliance and over-all higher quality of the final print image.

In other areas of dye based inks, the ChromaLife 100+ ink set has dropped the red and green primaries to add two shades of gray and a new magenta formulation which delivers better reds for improved black and shadow formulations. The two different shades of gray also help improve the range of the color gamut, and increase the ability of the printer to print more detailed and subtle shadings.

**Hi Speed and Improved Color Bring Professional Grade Printing To More Customers**

These new printers will also operate at higher speeds and should deliver more accurate color matching; they are scheduled to ship sometime in October. There is a constant stream of new ink and printer head technologies coming out which will insure an increased ability to print better and more professional photo and fine art pictures, and many of these inks are designed specifically to improve the outcome on glossy and other photo and fine art papers. As these inks hit the market, they are quickly absorbed into the consumer market place. The new color formulations, especially when combined with the new shadings of gray and black inks have the ability to make printing black and shadows much sharper the richer than before.

As these new formulations are hitting the market, and as more and more printers are using the expanded palettes of blacks and grays to get better and better photo and art printing makers of remanufactured and compatible cartridges will quickly be analyzing the new print heads and ink formulations, along with the new colors, to make sure there is a high quality, less expensive alternative to the factory cartridges. The [compatible ink](https://www.tomatoink.com/) industry has been very good at keeping pace with the major ink and printer manufacturers to make sure that their products are manufactured and formulated in the same way as the inks you would get straight from the manufacturers.

The expanded gray and black colors, though, are making the biggest difference in overall quality of the photo and art printing capabilities and the line between quality levels of consumer printers and professional grade printers is continuing to blur as better and better results are possible with printers that are more affordable.

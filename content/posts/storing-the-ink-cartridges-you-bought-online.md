All right, so you've run the calculations and realized that purchasing ink cartridges online is a cost-effective solution that will save you money over the long run. You've set up your new supply lines, informed the relevant people within your company, and checked the impeccable credentials of your new supplier. The first bulk shipment has arrived at your office, at a discount that your accountants are delighted with, so...Where do you actually put the darn things?While not that huge individually, cartridge boxes can actually take up quite a lot of space, and the delicate components preclude taking them out of their boxes and stacking them that way. Worse, you really don't want to have the cartridges damaged while they're waiting for use, so let's check out some of the best ways to store your ink cartridges while they're waiting for use.

One of the most simple and popular ways for any location that goes through a lot of ink is to purchase a cabinet of some kind, preferably with a door that can be shut. Cartridges can be stacked in here and split up in a variety of ways, like putting them together by color or separating them based on type if your location uses several different types of cartridges at the same time. If you feel security is an issue, it's not very difficult to place a lock on a cabinet and give the key to a supervisor, making it much more difficult for any employees to, for example, steal a box every now and then and sell it elsewhere for a little pocket money. Hopefully, this will never be a concern for your company, but this security option is available.

Some locations don't have much in the way of free space to put new furniture in, though, so you'll have to make do with what you have. If you have any kind of overhanging desk or table, the space beneath it can be another excellent place to store large numbers of cartridges for an extended period of time. This does pose a certain risk of the cartridges being damaged by the feet of people moving around, however, so the cartridges should be placed as far back as possible or protected by having something else (such as a cushion) placed in front of them. This will be entirely adequate for most facilities.

If placing cartridges beneath something isn't an option, it may be possible to place them above. Not all furniture reaches to the ceiling, so it's very possible to stack the ink cartridges on top of something else. You may want to add some kind of barrier to be sure they don't fall off, however, especially if they're being stacked close to the edge.

Now you know some of the best ways to store large amounts of ink cartridges safely. It often helps to set aside some room when you first make your order, and try to be sure that all cartridges can be retrieved in a timely manner when needed.

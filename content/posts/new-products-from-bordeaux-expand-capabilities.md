Bordeaux Digital Printink Ltd. has long been known in the development of specialty pigment applications, but they are offering an expanding line of inks and pigments. These products are geared for the most part towards developing and manufacturing formulations specifically for the inkjet inks used in commercial and industrial applications. They include new formulations which were showed off at the SGIA Expo 2012, one of the largest trade shows for the graphics industry.Among the new products showcased were Bordeaux's revolutionary latex inks to textile specific formulations, the popular Eco Solvent, UV LED solutions and new liquid laminates and coating lines.

The new latex formulations were shown at this show for the first time on an Imedia printer, and are specifically developed for inkjet printers using Epson DX printheads. These new latex inks provides faster print throughput, lower drying temperatures (which can save large amounts of energy in the long term) and which offer extremely high quality and reliability.  
**NEW PRODUCTS EXPAND CAPABILITIES** 

They are also suited to a wide variety of substrates and media and have excellent abrasion and scratch resistance as well as a very wide color gamut. The latex inks as well as most of Bordeaux's line are more geared towards the commercial industry, including printing on a wide variety of substances such as vehicle wraps, fabrics and packaging materials, but smaller and smaller printers are making use of non-traditional printing media, and that will continue to expand into the small business and consumer markets as smaller printers become more and more versatile.

They are also developing a broad range of eco responsible UV curable liquid coating which are made specifically for fleet graphics, floor graphics, POP and promotional materials. As with other manufacturers, Bordeaux has realized that it will become more and more essential to develop these eco-friendly formulations as time goes on, and in the long run they will not only be more ecologically sound but will also save money as older manufacturing processes are gradually phased out.

They are part of the new formulations lineup that also include Mild Solvent and True Solvent inks as well as the Eco Solvent. These newer formulations are geared towards use in all major printheads, including Xaar, Konica, Spectra, Epson, Toshiba and more, which covers almost all printer brands.  
**R&D PAYS OFF WITH NEW FORMULATIONS**

Their lines of UV and UV LED inks come in rigid, flexible and super flexible formulations that are compatible with a wide variety of applications. Smaller and smaller printers are making use of inks such as this, and are breaking into the small and home based business's which offer specialized printing services in a B2B capacity. They are designed to deliver high color quality, performance and exceptional reliability, especially for outdoor applications where traditional inks begin to break down in a fairly short period of time.

These technologies, just like all new ink formulations will be transferred to consumer grade printers as those smaller printers expand in capacity, and will no doubt be transferred readily to the remanufactured and compatible markets servicing OEM quality inkjet cartridges, [toner cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) and more.

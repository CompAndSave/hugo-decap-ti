* Wooden planks (ensure that the surface is smooth; if not use some sand paper to ensure that you have an even, clean surface to work with
* Wax paper (you can also use parchment paper)
* Your inkjet printer with adequate ink in the cartridges (a laser printer will not work because it uses dry toner as against fluid ink)
* Cutting implements
* Your fave photos, landscapes, or quotes of whatever it is you plan to print, reversed (ensure that the image of sufficient resolution to translate well into printed pictures. Add any filters or borders you need to, enhance contract etc; consider monochrome images or sepia tints too)

## How to Create Your DIY Photos Printed on Wood

The image you plan to print has to be reversed (flipped). Since you will be printing out a mirror image which will then be transferred. This is important for photos but particularly important for text, quotes or some patterns. Giving a print command from your mobile phone? Use apps such as this Photo Editor app from iTunes for Apple devices. For Android devices, use the Mirror Photo app on Google Play.

If you're using a Windows PC, open the image with Paint. Then on the Home Tab, click the ROTATE drop down menu. Next, click FLIP HORIZONTAL button to get a mirror image of your photo.

Once your picture is ready to print, insert a sheet of wax paper into the printer. If you're using parchment paper, use the shiny side (which will hold the ink but not absorb it). Give the print command. As the printed page emerges, ensure that the image doesn't come into contact with your fingers or any other surface. This will prevent smudging.

Now quickly place your image, wet side down on the wooden surface you've chosen to use. Smooth it down using a spatula or a credit card. When the ink has had time to transfer to the wood, carefully peel away the wax paper or parchment. Let the wooden surface dry and set and you're done!

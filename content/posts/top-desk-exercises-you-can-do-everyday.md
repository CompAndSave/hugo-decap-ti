So you have a desk job and you are tied to your desk all day long. You find that you just can't squeeze out the time to exercise on a regular basis; you probably find it rather frustrating that you cannot find the time and that you're not as physically active as you should be. But there are exercises that you can do right at your desk – exercises that don't need a jogging track or a gym. These are some moves that will help improve circulation and muscle tone while you work, possibly even make you feel less fatigued and physically stressed.

## Stretches

Stretching is important to prevent muscles cramping. It also helps to tone muscles. Stretch the neck by rotating it left and right as well as in a circular motion. Stretch the shoulders by shrugging them up toward the ears, stretching them as far back as possible and rotating them in a circular motion. Swivel your upper body 45 degrees from the waist, first to the right and then to the left. Ankle curls, wrist curls, and leg stretches are more moves that will help. And don't forget the hands, particularly the fingers. Bunch them up into fists and then quickly open them out. Just a few minutes of stretching will do you a power of good.

## Keep moving

Instead of taking the elevator take the stairs. If you have to give a memo to a colleague, don't email it to them, go over and hand it over personally. Take short breaks – get up and do a little jogging on the spot. You can even do this as you read a report or check your mail. If you're speaking on the phone, get up and take a walk. You don't have to be seated at your desk to speak on the phone – move around, take a brisk walk around the office or down the hall and back. Oh! And use a hand free set while you're at it, so you can leave your arms free.

## Keep the circulation going

Walk lunges, squats, and low impact jumping jacks or even marching on the spot will help keep up your circulation. Stretch your arms above your head and move your torso from side to side bending yourself at the waist. Change your position frequently to free up the leg muscles. Some people even recommend sitting cross legged or in a lotus position for short periods while sitting at the desk. Press the hands together in a Namaste position and press together till you feel it in your arms.

Do these stretches and simple exercises whenever you have a spare minute. Incorporate these into your daily activities; make them a habit and you will find yourself getting that little bit fitter and feeling less fatigued and stiff at the end of the day.

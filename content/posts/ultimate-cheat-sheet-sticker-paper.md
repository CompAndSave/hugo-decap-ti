Businesses often use stickers for posters and personalized labels. Create your own custom stickers in just a few simple steps.

## Design Your Sticker

First, find what photo or design on your computer that you want to use as a sticker. Certain software programs, such as Photoshop, will allow you to alter the color, text font, and filter. You also want to make sure your image is properly scaled to your desired sticker size.

## Pick the Right Sticker Paper

Next, you'll need to choose which [sticker photo paper](https://www.tomatoink.com/paper/sticker-paper) you would like to use. You need paper that is water resistant and compatible with your inkjet or laser printer. The glossy sticker paper option provides high-quality photo reproduction while matte sticker paper tends to be more water resistant. For inkjet printers, it's best to use glossy paper for a more vibrant sticker.

## Print Your Sticker

Before printing your stickers, verify that you have enough ink in your printer, especially if you are using color on your sticker. In addition, you should confirm on which side the paper will print. Sticker paper easily feeds through the printer when it is on top of other sticker paper. Place the paper in your printer, and you're ready to go.

## Start Sticking

Finally, after you have your printouts, simply cut the paper to the shape and size required. And now you can start sticking your paper wherever you want. Customize your business materials, notebooks, planners, craft projects, and more.

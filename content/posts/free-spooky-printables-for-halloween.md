If Halloween is a holiday that you enjoy with your family and even with your office colleagues, then we have some ideas here that you may enjoy. We've put together some spooky ideas to help you really enter into the spirit of things this Halloween. These are some simple do-it-yourself trick or treat box ideas that need little except good quality toner or [ink cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) in your printer and some card stock [printing paper](https://www.tomatoink.com/paper).

Here's what you will need:

* Good quality paper or card stock for printing (should be stiff enough to hold a box shape)
* Scissors (safety scissors if you plan to let kids do some of the cutting)
* Double sided tape or glue
* Goodies to put inside the box

How to make your own trick or treat boxes:

* Ensure that your printer cartridge or toner cartridge is properly installed. Also make sure that it isn't exhausted and that the cartridge will get you the desired number of printouts.
* Now click on the "DOWNLAD" link below the printable box of your choice. This will open another tab which is the PDF version of the "trick or treat" box.
* Now click "PRINT" from that browser's drop down menu. Make sure to print at 100%.
* Once you have the printout, cut neatly along the solid lines.
* Score and fold along the dashed lines.
* Use double sided tape or glue along the folds of the box to secure it.
* If you are making the pillow box, glue or tape one side closed so that it can hold the goodies you put into it.
* Stuff candy and other treats into the box from the other side and glue or tape it shut if you are making the pillow box. If you are making the coffin, insert the bottom piece into the top piece to keep it shut.
* Fill the name of the person in the space provided (A Halloween treat for——-)

And in case you don't have the time to print out and make those trick ‘n' treat boxes, simply print out and use our **Double Sided Gift Tags** to go with the goodie bags or boxes you're thinking of using. Just print, punch a hole as indicated and put a string or ribbon through it to attach to your goodie bag.

Now wait for those faces to light up when you present your unique little "Trick or treat" boxes stuffed with goodies!

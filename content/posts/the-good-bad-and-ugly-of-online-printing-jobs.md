If you run a business, whether it is online, brick and mortar, or a combination, chances are good that you will need printing jobs performed at some time or another. With today's printing technology, business owners now have three basic options when it comes to getting their printing work performed. Let's take a look at those and some of the problems that can arise from each. 

The first option many business owners have available for printing job is to do it themselves, in-house. With high quality ink jet cartridges and fast printers now commonly available, many printing jobs can be performed right in the office. This goes far beyond the usual black text on white paper printing most of us are accustomed to seeing done in the office. Modern printers and [toner cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) that can provide a variety of colors make in-house printing a snap.

There are a couple of drawbacks, however, to in-house printing. The first is that many businesses do not own a modern printer that may be capable of performing the task needed. Another drawback is that for large print runs, the cost can be prohibitive unless the business owner is buying his or her ink jet cartridges from a reliable and affordable vendor. And, finally, is the printing is slated for surface mail delivery to the customers, the order must still be packaged and mailed off. This can be very time consuming.

The second option business owners have is to hire a printing shop to the do the work. This is a viable option, especially if the printing job requires special coloring or materials. Print shops can be found locally, and often offer the best price for large print runs when compared to doing the work in-house.

The third option is to hire an online printing company. Many online printing companies are available on the web today and choosing one is not hard. Business owners should be careful, however, in choosing a company that has a track record of success and has the printing equipment needed to complete the task. The best way to determine exactly what type of printing equipment a company uses for its online customers is to visit their website and read what it says. Look for companies that are using high-quality printing techniques such as those found with well known brands. Kodak, would be an example.

It is also important to make sure that the online company can produce the material within your schedule. Many online printing companies will mail or ship your order to your customers if you select that option. Again, double check to ensure that they can fulfill the deadline before contracting with them.

One of the most advantageous benefits to working with online printers is that many will offer you access to their online print job software. This allows you to do much of the work yourself to ensure that you are getting exactly what you want. The software normally available for online use is generally easy to use and offers many point-and-click options to make the job of setting up the page fast and easy. Not all online printers offer this, so look for it if you need it before you contract with any one particular company.

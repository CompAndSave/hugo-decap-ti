It's no secret that a healthier heart can lead to a reduced chance of major problems, such as cardiac arrest or heart attacks. February is American Heart Month and a great opportunity to take the time to put a little focus on heart health. Here are a few healthy hobbies you can add to your daily routine to significantly reduce your chance of getting heart disease.

## Eat More Superfoods

Superfoods are exactly what they sound like, [foods rich in nutrients](https://www.tomatoink.com/blog/posts/how-to-make-your-own-healthy-recipe-binder.html), fiber and healthy fats that have a super positive impact on your heart. Avocados, almonds, salmon and berries are all great examples of superfoods you should be super excited about.

## Supplement Your Superfoods

Implementing a healthy diet is great, but it still may not be providing you with all the essential nutrients you need on a daily basis. Fish oil and complete probiotics are just a couple of supplements you can add to your daily routine to help reduce blood pressure and balance your digestive system.

## Walk 30 Minutes A Day

Find some time before or after your workday for a light workout. Regular exercise is crucial for a healthier heart, but it doesn't have to be as intensive as you may think. It is recommended that you get 2.5 hours of [moderate exercise](https://www.tomatoink.com/blog/posts/top-desk-exercises-you-can-do-everyday.html) per week. So, if you go on a brisk walk or light jog for 30 minutes before getting ready for work each day, you're already done.

## Laugh More

Stress is one of the worst things we can put our body through. It increases blood pressure and anxiety and makes for restless nights, which are all harmful to our heart. To avoid stress, try making a list of your top priorities for each day (and make it attainable), don't sweat the small stuff, spend time laughing with loved ones and set aside some time each week for your favorite activity.

## Read (A Real Book) at Night

It doesn't have to be a book, it can be your favorite magazine, newspaper, etc. Just make sure it's not on a screen. Studies show that looking at a TV, tablet, computer or phone screen within an hour of your bedtime can lead to restless nights. Good sleep is very important to maintaining heart health, so don't sacrifice it just to check your phone one last time.

These are just a few healthy hobbies to consider adding to your daily routine. For more information, tips and recipes, [check us out on Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/tomatoinktoner/american-heart-month/).

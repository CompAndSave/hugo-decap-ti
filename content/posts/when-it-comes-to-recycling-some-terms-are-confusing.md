Many people want to do their part to help clean up the Earth. One way they do this is through recycling of their ink cartridges, laser toner cartridges, compatible ink, printer ink cartridges, etc. But, many people become confused when they see so many different terms being used. The EPA has decided to help these individuals by reducing it all down to three simple words: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. Knowing what these terms mean will help anyone who needs to handle ink cartridges, laser toner cartridges, and printer ink cartridges that are no longer serviceable.

Reduce, according to the EPA, means to do more but do so by using less. For those who use printers, this might mean printing fewer documents by saving more on hard drives. Or it might mean using both sides of a piece of paper rather than just one. Many companies will find that they can reduce their ink cartridges, laser toner cartridges, printer ink cartridge costs and consumption by making sure that they always store these items properly. There are many ways a company can reduce its ink cartridge requirements, and this, of course, helps to keep them out of landfills.

A good way to recycle old ink cartridges is to simply send them back the manufacturer who can use most of the parts to make new, [remanufactured cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/environmentally-friendly-green-ink-and-toner-cartridges).

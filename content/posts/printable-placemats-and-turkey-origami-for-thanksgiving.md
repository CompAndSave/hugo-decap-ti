The holiday season is upon us! This is a time when tradition rules and family gatherings are a must. A time when every activity is meant to express the love and happiness you share with your family and close friends. Thanksgiving combines the idea of togetherness and showing gratitude for the things you have. Every activity, from the Thanksgiving feast to the ever so popular football game, is meant to bring the family together for one special day. Here's another wonderful activity that any child and adult can enjoy in order to bring the family together and express their gratitude in a very decorative and colorful way. 

As a new part of your Thanksgiving tradition, have more fun with this coloring activity and master the art of paper folding when you decorate these Thanksgiving themed dinner placemats and turkey origami.

**What you need to get started:**

* Glue (kid friendly)
* Scissors (kid friendly)
* Coloring materials (crayons, markers, colored pencils, paint, etc.)
* Children and adults ready to have some fun
* Someone willing to print out the placemats, as well as the origami designs and receive a whole lot of smiles and hugs in return

**Download the placemats and origami turkey images:**

* Click on the link below to "DOWNLOAD" the place mats and the origami designs with the instructions (this will open a PDF file version)
* Click "PRINT" to print out the images in your desired size (make sure to print out a substantial amount for everyone and remember that the place mats should be double sided)
* Once everything is downloaded, printed out and passed around, it's time to get creative while spending quality time with your family!

Ensure that everyone has a place reserved at the dinner table by setting their colored place mats on the area they plan to sit in for dinner. After the meal, you can keep the fun alive by making more origami turkeys and solving the puzzles on the reversed side of the place mats. To really get into the Thanksgiving spirit, decorate your home with these unique designs by posting the place mats on the fridge or walls and placing the origamis on various parts of the house.

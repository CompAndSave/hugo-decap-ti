### Water Count Sticker Paper Printables

Do you get to the end of your day and realize how parched your mouth feels? Here's how to fix that. First, take a large [BPA-free eco-friendly water bottle](https://www.tomatoink.com/blog/posts/12-tips-working-out-in-the-summer.html) to work with you and keep close by on your desk/workstation. Next, you might get better at drinking throughout the day if you had reminders on your water bottle. Our water count printable stickers are perfect for keeping track of your water consumption. Begin with the "Filled" sticker and end with the "Refill" sticker. Don't forget that most health professionals [recommend](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/tc/drinking-enough-water-topic-overview#1) that you drink about 64 ounces of water per day.

HP 56 / 57 Compatible Ink Cartridges

There is a lot of information floating around the internet about remanufactured ink cartridges, some of it reputable and true, some of it complete garbage. But how are you supposed to be able to separate the facts from the nonsense? Luckily, we've done the work for you and we're here to give you a crash course on [remanufactured ink cartridges.](https://www.tomatoink.com/help/sections/8290264394893/ink-cartridge-lingo)

First off, let's start with just what, exactly, a remanufactured ink cartridge is. A remanufactured ink cartridge is pretty much what it sounds like. When you drop off your empty ink cartridges at Staples, Office Max, or any of the other hundreds of office supply stores that offer to recycle your empty ink cartridges, you are participating in this cycle! Those empty ink cartridges are sent to a manufacturer, who thoroughly cleans them, refills the empty cartridges to capacity, replaces any non-functioning parts, and then repackages and re-sells the cartridge at a deeply discounted price.

There are a few major myths out there regarding remanufactured ink cartridges. The one you are most likely the come across is also the scariest one: the threat that using a remanufactured ink cartridge will void the warranty on your printer. This one is responsible for a lot of consumers being battered into buying expensive, original manufacturer ink cartridges, but luckily, it is completely false. It is so wrong in fact, that it is completely illegal. The Fair Trade laws forbid making the use of a specific product a condition of the warranty unless that product is provided at no cost to the consumer. So if your printer manufacturer insists on telling you that it will void your warranty, just insist they provide you with free ink cartridges. We think their tune will change rather quickly.

The second biggest myth regarding remanufactured ink cartridges that you are likely to come across is that [remanufactured ink cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) are lower quality than new, original manufacturer cartridges. This is simply not true. There are all sorts of studies by independent testing labs that certify **remanufactured ink cartridges work and preform just as well, sometimes even better, than new manufacturer cartridges.** Now, like any other industry, there are inferior companies out there, but so long as you do a little research and look into the company, it should be clear who is genuine and who is looking for a quick buck. There is nothing to suggest that remanufactured cartridges are in any way inferior to those produced by the original manufacturer.

Don't let original manufacturers' scare tactics keep you from saving up to 70% on remanufactured ink cartridges. Not only are you doing your wallet a huge favor, you are doing a great service to the environment too. Millions of empty ink and [toner cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) end up in landfills and trash dumps all over the world. By reusing just one of those cartridges, you are making a difference for the world. Make sure you are working with a reputable company to source your remanufactured ink cartridges, like [TomatoInk](https://www.tomatoink.com/). Talk to friends and family, or search online forums to hear other people's experiences. You want to work with a company that cares about their products as much as you care about your printer, so be sure to check out TomatoInk for all your remanufactured ink cartridge needs!

**Well Thought Out Infrastructure Is the Sign of a Good Company**

The meeting of the internet and the real world has never been more integrated than it is now; in more and more communities across America, you can order an ink or laser toner cartridge, like the Konica Minolta Replacement 2300-BK Toner Cartridge, and have it delivered to your business in a few days - and in many areas, the next day. In some select markets, companies are trying same day delivery as well.

To deliver nationwide on this scale takes expertise and an efficient, well thought out plan as well as real world infrastructure and a web infrastructure that includes an easy to use website, good customer service and customer security. It is essential that both aspects of the business mesh in a coherent. It is not easy to set up both ends of this puzzle so that they overlap into an easy customer experience.

**How to Tell A Well Run Operation**

When it comes to shopping online, the customer has pretty simple expectations. They want good customer service, a wide range of high quality products and quick and inexpensive shipping.

They don't think about the large inventory a good retailer has to keep on hand, especially in the [compatible ink](https://www.tomatoink.com/) cartridge field. All they want to know is whether the ink cartridge or toner cartridge they need is in stock; such hard to find items like the Okidata Replacement C6100 Series/C5550n MFP Magenta 43324418 Laser Toner Cartridge.

How long the company has been in business is an excellent indicator ofn how good their products and customer service are, as the companies which supply poor customer service are usually out of business in a year or two. If you choose a company that has been in business at least five years, you have a much better chance of being satisfied with your purchase in the short and the long run..

Shipping and warranty terms should be spelled out in easy to understand language, and the good website almost always offer same day shipping if an order is placed early enough. That is one of the strengths of this cross platform integration when done right - it means that someone is paying attention at the company, so seeing these things lets you know that as much thought went into the back end of the company as has gone into the website. One is useless without the other.

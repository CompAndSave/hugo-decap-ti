With the internet and other communication tools at our disposal, it's easier than ever before to work from home. Working from home has obvious advantages – kids can be supervised, many overhead expenses can be avoided and you don't have to deal with the tiresome daily commute. Working from home saves you a lot of time and lets you optimize the resources you have at your disposal.

But– how do you create a space that is organized, productive, comfortable and functional? Here are some tips to help you create an ideal home office space for yourself:

### Create a proper office space

[![](/blog/images/archive/2014/10/500_1189707263_home_office_ca.jpg)](/blog/images/archive/2014/10/500%5F1189707263%5Fhome%5Foffice%5Fca.jpg)

Make use of that guest bedroom, basement area, or spare room in your home that you rarely use– ideally you should have a dedicated area for your home office. If you cannot use an entire room, use a partition or create a dedicated space within the room for your office. It should be a clearly demarcated space where the family knows not to intrude without sufficient reason. Remember, just because it's a home office, doesn't mean there isn't serious work going on.

### Follow basic rules of ergonomics

Your workstation design is vitally important since you will be spending several hours if not the entire workday in your home office. You need to have the desk at the right height, a chair that is both comfortable and supportive, and all basic office implements within easy reach. For some, a standup desk, a kneeling chair, or even a treadmill in your workstation could be a good idea, ergonomically speaking. These could help you avoid occupational hazards such as repetitive stress injuries and chronic pain.

### Carefully consider what you really need

A desk, chair, sufficient storage, your computer and peripherals, shelves or cabinets for files, stationery, and books are the basic items to for any home office. If you envisage having to meet with clients or other business associates in your office you should have additional seating options. Do you really need any other item of furniture cluttering up your office space? Keep it simple and spare; let there be enough space to move around and let there be less clutter.

### Keep your technology up to date

Technology, gadgets and software can really help simplify your work processes. Take advantage of this! Since technology is constantly being upgraded and improved, keep track of these changes and perform maintenance checks while keeping your data backed up. Also, ensure that your antivirus software is up to date; you don't want your computer crashing and precious data lost. Remember, in your home office you are your own boss and your own employee, so it's up to you to keep office up and running smoothly, without technical glitches.

### Let there be light

Natural light is very important – it keeps you feeling upbeat and can help you avoid the blues as you type away on your computer by yourself. Since natural light is not always possible (and you may frequently work during non daylight hours) sufficient ambient lighting for the entire space and focus lighting for your desk are also important. Not only does a well lighted space make you feel better, it helps to avoid eye fatigue, headaches and so on.

### A place for everything, everything in its place

Proper storage space is important so that you can keep your office space neat, organized and free of clutter. This makes for more efficient working and better productivity, and you also waste less time searching for things you need.

### Pay attention to the décor

You need to like the space that you call your home office. After all you're going to be spending a lot of time in there. Consider a cheery color on the walls, drapes that you enjoy looking at, a few family photos or a wall art that brightens up the place, and perhaps a few potted plants. Adding a few creative touches here will give you something nice to look at and could provide some much needed inspiration too!

### Shop smart

It's important to keep your operating costs low – this helps add to the overall profitability of your business. To a large extent you can do that effortlessly in your home office. In practical terms, there are no overheads such as electricity, rent and other running costs. You can also ensure that you shop online for office supplies.

Not only does that save you the time that it would take to run down to the store, but you can also take advantage of online sales and discounts. Shopping for discounted printer cartridges for any printer brand, buy refill kits, bulk ink, cables & accessories and photo paper can make a significant difference to your finances.

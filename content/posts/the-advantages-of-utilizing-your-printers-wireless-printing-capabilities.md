Most modern printers these days come with the now standard claim of wireless printing capabilities, or Wi-Fi. These days, it is so common for printers to have this function, users may simply overlook it, but there are some real advantages to setting up and using your printer's wireless capabilities. There are generally detailed instructions that come with your printer for setting up the wireless printing feature, but if you'd prefer, such a job is quite simple for office IT or a quick call to a local computer service company.

The single biggest advantage to printing wirelessly is that multiple computers and employees may all print from a single computer without the need to constantly unplug and replug in connection cords. If you've ever tried to share a single printer between two computers, even two that are located right next to each other, you know the hassle of hitting the print button, nothing happening, and then struggling for several minutes, just to discover that the printer is plugged in to the other computer. With wireless printing enabled, those issues are no longer even a thought. Because each computer can connect to the printer using a Wi-Fi signal many people can connect to a central printer and no longer worry about whether they are directly connected or not.

Especially in an office environment, but even at home, safety is key, and long, tangled printer cords can be a real safety hazard. Running printer cables all over the office to ensure that everyone can connect can put employees in serious risk of tripping and falling over haphazardly run cables. Even in your home excess cables can be a hazard to pets and young children, not to mention just being an eyesore. Wireless printing avoids these cables all together and makes for a cleaner, safer work environment, whether at home or in the office.

As smartphone and tablet technology improves we are getting more and more important documents on our personal devices and sometimes we need to print these! In the past, there was no way to print directly from these devices because they did not have the correct plugs to accommodate the printer's cords. Wireless printing bypasses that step all together and lets you set up personal devices so that they can print directly to a printer as well.

And since you are now free from the grip of printer cables, there is no worry or limitation of where you put your printer! In the past office buildings and homes where forced to place these devices in certain locations where they could be within the cords length of the computer they needed to be connected to. Thankfully, with Wi-Fi capabilities, that is no longer the case and printers can be placed wherever they are convenient for everyone, not where their cord length dictates!

Whether printing documents or photographs, when you utilize your printer's Wi-Fi capabilities you can easily expand your printing horizons. You'll save yourself money by needing fewer printers, avoiding the need to buy long, costly cables, and making printing more efficient and easier overall.

## Why Epson Met High-Volume Retail Requirements

It was recently announced that Groupon Breadcrumb Systems has selected Epson's receipt printers for its point-of-sale (POS) system. One reason the Epson was selected is said to be its workhorse reliability as well as the company's overall reputation for excellence. The system run on iPads and is used most often in bars, restaurants, and cafes.

According to Greg Brunnick, who is the director of marketing, Epson business systems division, the system was also selected because, "Epson holds such a large market share in food service, we're a natural fit. We're looking forward to working with Groupon to enhance their offerings in local businesses." Food service industries have long been looking for better options to handle their many needs.From order printouts that are delivered to the kitchen to labeling product, there are many industry specific needs that food service vendors are in need of. It now appears that many of the leading [inkjet cartridge](https://www.tomatoink.com/) and laser toner vendors are beginning to invest time and money in coming up with high-quality solutions to these problems.

In other news, it was also reported that Epson recently released its TM-L90 liner-free thermal receipt printer. The release took place in the Middle East, and the unit is able to deliver high-quality adhesive-backed receipts which can be used in a variety of ways including labeling storage containers and delivery containers as well as many other uses. These receipt products are most often used for labeling food and drink orders, and one of its many benefits is that is compatible with either 40 and 80mm paper widths. The unit's automatic top margin reduction feature also lets it save paper. Saving paper has become a major concern for many users of receipt labeling machines and this new feature may soon find its way to other types of printers that use a lot of smaller sized papers.

It was also recently announced that the new Samsung CLX 8385NX has been noted for delivering high-quality color prints as well as clean, bold text. According to Hardware.info, the new laser system is able to produce very high-quality printouts that looked "great". The report stated that Hardware had run all of its testing measurements using the system's default settings. It was also reported that they used Samsung's software. This software can be downloaded from the company site and allows users to configure various settings to meet their own needs and requirements.

Also, the new Samsung CLX-4195FW system has been recommended by PCMag.com. The magazine gave the system a rating of four out of five score. According to its report, PCMag states that the new system is a great option for those needing high-quality output but are working on a budget. The system was also touted for its energy saving abilities. It was also reported that the new inkjet system is able to deliver about 20,000 pages of output on a single ink jet cartridge. This is somewhat remarkable and is sure to be one of the machine's best selling points as more consumers and businesses become aware of it.

**How to Find a Good Retailer of Ink Cartridges**

A good sign that you're dealing with a professional company is the customer service. Pay close attention to the shipping charges, and whether they keep you notified and supply tracking numbers for your product. These are great indicators of a responsible reseller who has the customer's best interests at heart.

The customer service of a company allows you to see how the outfit is run before you actually spend money. When you call customer service are they helpful at finding exactly the right product that you need? Do they answer all your questions about the product? And how long did it take them to come on the line? A small delay is understandable - sometimes people get busy. But how they treat you after you are on the line is the important part of the customer service experience.

Pay special attention to how the cartridges are made - this is a big deal, as this is the number one area where cheap suppliers save money. There are two types of cartridges that will meet your price requirements; remanufactured and compatible cartridges. A good ink cartridge reseller will take pains with each product that they sell to make sure they work just as good as the OEM cartridges that you would pay much more for.

With remanufactured cartridges, they should be completely disassembled - then inspected, cleaned and rebuilt. The remanufactured laser toner cartridge or ink cartridge should be as good as or better than the factory OEM standards. This includes the ink - this process must be done with high quality ink or toner which meets or exceeds the OEM standards.

Compatible cartridges, however, are manufactured from scratch, but they should be made with the same attention to detail and be made to the same exacting standards as the OEM equipment.

Follow the tips and hints above to make sure you are dealing with a reputable company, and it will be possible to save a large amount of money on your ink and toner needs.

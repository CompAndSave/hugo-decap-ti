[![party invitation printables ](/blog/images/archive/2015/06/printsummerinvitations.png)](/blog/images/archive/2015/06/printsummerinvitations.png)Did you know that June 21st is the longest day of the year in the Northern hemisphere? The long daylight hours, and the fact that this is the middle of summer, naturally have had a positive influence on human cultures over the ages. Back in the day, the summer solstice was an important way to mark the passage of the seasons and also helped develop calendars.

Traditionally, various festivities would mark the summer solstice – feasting, lighting bonfires, fertility rites and various pagan ceremonies marked the day. So why not make Summer Solstice special for you as well? Here are some ideas for you to mark this, the longest day of the year; some fun, some meaningful activities:

**10 Summer Activities For the Longest Day of the Year**

1. **Watch and sunrise or the sunset** – Identify a good spot in advance and enthrall yourself with the stunning hues of nature as the sun comes up or goes down.
2. **Barbecue, cookout, pool party or picnic** – This is easily one of the most popular ideas for celebrating the solstice; a fun, sociable activity that everyone enjoys. Plus this year, 21 June falls on a Sunday, that's ideal even for working people and school going kids. (we have some great invite ideas and a surprise for you at the end of the post)
3. **Take a walk in the forest** – It can be among the most relaxing and invigorating things to do: stroll along foot paths listening to bird song, enjoying the sights and smells of the woods – sure to get you charged up!
4. **Visit the beach** – You can do as much or as little as you like at the beach. Surf, swim, enjoy some water sport or just veg out with a book and a drink of choice!
5. **Plant a tree (or two or three)** – You could decide to do this on your own or organize a tree planting initiative consisting of like minded people in your neighborhood or among your friends. Plant trees, nurture them and watch them grow as the day progresses. Be sure to pick hardy, soil and climate appropriate saplings and the right spot for planting.
6. **Take in a concert** – If there isn't something in your immediate vicinity, you could make a weekend trip out of this.
7. **Go fishing** – Or golfing or whatever it is that you enjoy doing most. A day out in the sun and fresh air will do you a power a good!
8. **Be a ‘day tripper'** – Not like the Beatles song, but go ahead and take that trip you've been meaning to: visit a monument, a museum, a park, a wildlife preserve, zoo, or a historical site.
9. **Start a Team with the Alzheimer's Association** – [The Longest Day](http://act.alz.org/site/TR?fr%5Fid=6650&pg=informational&sid=20684) is daylong event and fundraiser devoted to raising awareness of this deadly disease; highlighting the challenges that sufferers and caregivers face. This can be a meaningful activity for summer solstice, particularly if someone close to you has Alzheimer's
10. **A treasure hunt** – You can organize this as a great way for your entire family to meet up and bond or have like minded friends over for this. Have fun picking out gifts and treats, printing out signs and clues and maps for the event.

As companies grow, it becomes more and more important to pay attention to infrastructure matters. These material and man power costs can gradually creep up, and unless a business pays attention to such things they can be giving thousands of dollars away when they don't have to.If you work for a large company then you know this phenomenon. It is easy with a small operation to keep track of costs and exactly what is happening with all the disparate parts of the company, such as printing costs.But as companies grow, many times there is a lack of proper oversight to make sure the company is operating as efficiently as it can. When a company has dozens or hundreds of printers, the amount of money spent on incidental costs such as ink and paper can skyrocket unless someone is paying attention to such matters.

**PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR SUPPLY CHAIN - BIG MONEY IS AT STAKE**

Ink is a perfect example. If you are in charge of purchasing material for your company, how do you buy your ink? Is it from the manufacturer, or manufacturer's ink from whatever office supply store happens to be close to you or the branch that needs the new laser toner cartridge?

If that is the way you are buying ink, you are overpaying for you ink cartridges by a large amount. The printer industry, especially for smaller printers which most businesses and home users use have designed their profit model to shift a large portion of the profit from the printer to the supply of ink (the business end of this model is going to be a good bit bigger than what is on your desk, but is still considered a 'small' printer by the standards of the companies that make printers).

**DROP SHIP TO ALL BRANCHES - BUYING ONLINE ALLOWS YOU TO REFINE YOUR SUPPLY SYSTEM**

The Brother MFC series of printers is very popular and capable; a set of Brother Cartridges like the [Brother TN115 Bulk set](https://www.tomatoink.com/Brother-TN115-Black-Color-High-Yield-Toner-Cartridges-4-pack) of 4 retails for over $350.00, but this 4 color set of laser toner cartridges can be acquired at a much cheaper price. Quality is also important though. You can save a lot of money using online ink suppliers, but it is essential that you are getting a quality product that will print the same perfect prints as your original equipment did.

These cartridges are made with very strict standards to exact OEM specifications, and there are two general types. These include compatible cartridges, like the one specified above and remanufactured cartridges.

Compatible cartridges are built brand new, and should be identical to the OEM cartridge, including the way that it fits into the printer. The ink is also very important, and the online ink suppliers who take their business seriously are very careful to reproduce the ink formulations exactly so that you do get the beautiful prints that you are used to.

With the above cartridge, you can save over $190.00 when you buy these laser [toner cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) online - you can see how quickly this can make a big difference if you multiply that by 10 or a hundred.

Before ordering online, check to make sure they talk about how their product is made - it should be very specific about the care of the manufacturing process, and the warranty should be easy to activate, and be at least six months. One year is better.

You can save money and get great prints, and with online ordering it is easy to get the same deal for every branch you operate by drop shipping these cartridges directly to your subsidiary locations.

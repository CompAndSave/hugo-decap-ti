It's going to be that fun, festive time of year soon and we thought we would put together some more of our free printable decorations for Christmas. After our [Thanksgiving Themed Table Mats](https://www.tomatoink.com/blog/posts/printable-placemats-and-turkey-origami-for-thanksgiving.html) and our [Halloween Themed Printables](https://www.tomatoink.com/blog/posts/why-you-should-hand-out-printables-this-halloween.html) got such a good response, we thought we would put together some free printable décor items for the holidays – so that you can really get into the festive spirit of things with the entire family.

[TomatoInk](https://www.tomatoink.com/) team has put together some printable **Christmas tree ornaments**, paper cut out ornaments, cute animal cutouts and gift tags & labels that you can use to decorate your home and spend some quality time with your family.

There are two versions of each ornament: the first is the colored version and the second consists of outline drawings that can be colored in – this really gets kids into the festive spirit; besides coloring is a fun activity any time!

**Here's what you will need for your free** **Christmas printables**:

* A printer (ensure that the [ink cartridge](https://www.tomatoink.com/) has sufficient amount of ink)
* Good quality card stock for printing
* Scissors (safety scissors are a good bet if kids are going to "help")
* Crayons, poster colors or other coloring material (if required)
* A hole puncher
* String / festive ribbons

**Follow these simple steps to get the printouts of the Christmas decorations:**

* Click on the décor item of your choice – this will open up a PDF page
* Print the page using good quality paper
* Cut along the outer lines to get the proper ornament shape
* If it's the outline image that you printed, you can now color it in
* Use a hole puncher to make a small hole where indicated
* Insert string through the hole and there you have your **Christmas ornament** ready!

You can hang these ornaments on your Christmas tree, hang them up on walls, doors and windows, and even string them up over the fire place on the mantle to add a Christmas feel to the entire home.

As for the gift tags and labels, you could use them any one of two ways – (a) you could simply use double sided sticky tape to glue them on to gifts, or (b) you could use a hole puncher and insert decorative string or brightly colored satin ribbons (you can also use gold or silver ribbon or striped ribbons) to attach the labels to the gifts. This will give your decorations a uniquely beautiful look no matter how you use them.

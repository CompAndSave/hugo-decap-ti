TomatoInk planted 251 trees in the Boreal Forest with One Tree Planted

We are thrilled to announce we've planted 251 more trees in the Boreal Forest through our [Earth Day](http://mandrillapp.com/track/click/30152516/www.tomatoink.com?p=eyJzIjoiRjQxMUpnUFBqZkNwclBRZlBOTnBGbXZEcGx3IiwidiI6MSwicCI6IntcInVcIjozMDE1MjUxNixcInZcIjoxLFwidXJsXCI6XCJodHRwOlxcXC9cXFwvd3d3LnRvbWF0b2luay5jb21cXFwvY2FtcGFpZ25cXFwvaW5kZXhcXFwvZWFydGhkYXkxNVwiLFwiaWRcIjpcIjA3OWM3OTY1YmJlMTQwODZiZjkwNzhkMjNlYzZhYTViXCIsXCJ1cmxfaWRzXCI6W1wiYWJlMzAzNDY0ZTBkZmVhYjA0YzVhMzFmMTYyMTY3YzgyMWM0MWFhNVwiXX0ifQ) sponsorship of [One Tree Planted](http://onetreeplanted.org/) this year. In just a week, from April 20th to April 27th 2015, through the help of your purchases we were able to grow and preserve a forest home to more than 12 million wildlife species.

**TomatoInk's Earth Day Tree Planting Initiative**

For Earth Day this year, we wanted to commemorate it by doing special that would make a positive impact on our environment. We found One Tree Planted, non-profit plants trees with every dollar donation given, and worked together with them to aide in reforesting our planet through our latest campaign: [Go Green in Any Hue](http://mandrillapp.com/track/click/30152516/www.tomatoink.com?p=eyJzIjoiRjQxMUpnUFBqZkNwclBRZlBOTnBGbXZEcGx3IiwidiI6MSwicCI6IntcInVcIjozMDE1MjUxNixcInZcIjoxLFwidXJsXCI6XCJodHRwOlxcXC9cXFwvd3d3LnRvbWF0b2luay5jb21cXFwvY2FtcGFpZ25cXFwvaW5kZXhcXFwvZWFydGhkYXkxNVwiLFwiaWRcIjpcIjA3OWM3OTY1YmJlMTQwODZiZjkwNzhkMjNlYzZhYTViXCIsXCJ1cmxfaWRzXCI6W1wiYWJlMzAzNDY0ZTBkZmVhYjA0YzVhMzFmMTYyMTY3YzgyMWM0MWFhNVwiXX0ifQ)!  
For this initiative, we informed our shoppers that for every purchase made from April 20th to April 27th using our coupon code EDAY, we would donate a $1 to One Tree Planted. Plus, for every order placed using the coupon code EDAY, we gave them 12% off any ink or toner cartridge orders.

Together, with all of you who made a purchase during our Earth Day initiative, we managed to have 251 trees planted in North America's Boreal Forest. This was our small contribution towards the larger goal of taking action against climate change and ecosystem damage. [TomatoInk](https://www.tomatoink.com) is proud to have been a part of One Tree Planted's One Dollar, One Tree initiative and want to take the time to say yet another wholehearted _**Thank You**_ to all of you out there who made it happen!

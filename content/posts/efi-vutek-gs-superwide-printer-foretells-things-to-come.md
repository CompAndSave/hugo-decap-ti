**New Technology Making an Impact on Commercial Printing** 

EFI is a company that many people have never heard of, but that is going to change in a short time. They have perfected the art of the super wide format, which has high enough quality to print POP images and capacity large enough to print on billboard sized sheets. The EFI VUTEk GS5000r is a five meter roll to roll UV printer. The quality is there, but the printer operates very quickly. The printer offers higher resolutions than the norm for this size machine, and uses a unique multi-layer white ink process. The printers and the inks that are being developed for it will be able to print on a variety of disparate media, polystyrene among them.

**How They Will Affect the Home Market**

These giant inkjet printers may seem like they have nothing to do with your home and small business, but what it signifies is that commercial printing techniques and equipment are gradually being miniaturized. EFI has products that are now suitable for the home, home based business or small business where the ability to perform production print and fine photography is necessary. These are the smaller cousins of the GS5000r. In the R family of printers, you still get UV roll-to-roll photographic quality images using a four color cartridge system.

**Wide Printers Breaking Into New Markets**

Small, specialty businesses have never had it better. We are going through a revolution of unprecedented advances in information technology and production equipment, and small businesses and startups are the major benefactors of this type of equipment becoming inexpensive enough for smaller players to afford it, and to still get great results with stunning POP quality graphics. This machine will increase your work load ability like little else, and enable a small business to create content on demand or a small sign or graphics company extending what they can do for their customers in house.

Printers like this continue to grow more and more inexpensive at a quicker rate, and as they become more mainstream their inking technologies will also filter down into the home and small business consumer. These consumers can't spend as much, but there are many more of them. As this happens, you will be able to save a lot of money on compatible ink and inkjet [ink cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/).

The wide format printer has special needs, and the current wide formats ink of choice is Rastek. These inks are known for their high color quality - they consistently provide the best results, but as wide format inkjet printers become more and more affordable, there will be printer ink cartridges available at specialty ink distributors that will be able to save the wise consumer even more money.

As the wide printer technology is refined and the manufacturing increases, more and more uses will be found for it thanks to its lowering costs. Once a certain point is reached, artists and hobbyists and home business owners who will want to print their own promotional material will be buying into the new systems.

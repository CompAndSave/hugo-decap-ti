It's that spooky time of year again and this year we are really getting into the Halloween spirit with some ideas for healthy treats and candy bar recipes that you can use. When kids knock on your door demanding tricks and treats, you don't necessarily have to hand out store bought sweets, typically laden with sugar, corn syrup, unhealthy fats, artificial flavors and colors.

You can be uniquely different when you hand out homemade treats that are not only healthier than store bought ones, but also fairly easy to make.

## Healthy homemade Twix bars

These homemade chocolates are great because you get to control what goes into them – they are gluten free so it can be a great idea even for kids with gluten allergies. Here's what you'll need:

[![Homemade Twix Bars](/blog/images/archive/2014/10/AHumbleBumbleHomemadeTwix2.jpg)](/blog/images/archive/2014/10/AHumbleBumbleHomemadeTwix2.jpg)

* ½ a cup of white rice flour (you could also use buckwheat flour)
* 2 tbsp evaporated cane juice (you can also use coconut sugar; if not use regular sugar)
* ½ a cup of arrowroot (you can also use tapioca)
* 2 tbsp coconut oil
* 1 tbsp vanilla essence or extract
* 3 + another 3 tbsp butter (nut or seed butters work pretty well here)
* 1 tbsp flax powder blended with 2 tbsp water
* A few pitted dates
* Water as required
* 3/4 cooking chocolate

First, combine the two flours and the cane juice in a bowl, and then add 3 tbsp of the nut or seed butter, flax mixture and the vanilla. Blend well and ensure that the mixture is even with no lumps. You should have a doughy consistency. Shape the dough into cookies of the desired shape (you could use fun cutout shapes as well) and flatten them on a cookie sheet on an oven tray. Bake until the cookies appear light golden brown. Take them out of the oven and wait until cool.

Meanwhile take the dates, the remaining 3 tbsp of the nut butter and about a tbsp of water and blend this to form a smooth mixture (you may need to add a bit more water). Put a dollop of this paste atop each cookie to cover it completely and evenly. Place in the freezer for about half an hour.

Meanwhile, melt the cooking chocolate in a double boiler. Remove the cookies from the freezer and dip each of them in the liquid chocolate one by one. Place these on another baking sheet (even foil will do, you just need to be able to peel away the finished bars easily after they set) and freeze again. When they are nice and firm, wrap them in pretty foil, clear or colorful plastic sheets or other wrappers of your choice.

## Simple homemade chocolates

What you need:

* 1 kg Cooking chocolate (use milk chocolate rather than dark chocolate; kids usually prefer the sweeter taste)
* 2 cups Mixed chopped nuts, roasted and/ or dried fruits such as raisins
* Chocolate mold trays in fun shapes
* Foil for wrapping

In a double boiler, melt the cooking chocolate (you can use a microwave for this, but you do have to very careful not to scorch the chocolate as it melts; this ensure that you break it down into small pieces). Drop roasted nuts and/or raisins into the chocolate tray molds. Put just two or three pieces in each and then spoon the liquid chocolate into each mold. Tap the tray on your work surface so the chocolate settles and covers the nuts completely. Refrigerate for a few hours and then wrap each individual chocolate in colorful foil or even clear plastic sheets tied with a pretty twine bow.

So here's wishing you a sweet, fun filled and enjoyable Halloween. We do hope that you enjoy using these DIY ideas.

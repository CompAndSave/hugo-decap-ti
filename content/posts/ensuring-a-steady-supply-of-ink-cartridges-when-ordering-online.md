Like all products that have something consumed in order to be used, printers often need to have a particular part replaced in order to continue functioning. This guide will examine some ways to ensure that whatever printer your home or business is using is able to have refills on the ink for as long as possible.The first thing you should do is figure out how old your printer is. Often, new printer lines come with a new style of cartridge designed to effectively integrate with the printer and provide all the necessary printing ability.

Each cartridge will probably be produced for quite some time as part of the general support that manufacturers offer. However, every cartridge line stops eventually, and the older a printer is, the more likely that its line will be next to be cut off.

Once you've determined which cartridges you will be using, talk to your ink cartridge provider about their stock of that particular unit, how often they're resupplied, and if they have any idea when supplies might stop coming. This information can provide you with a good basis for making a decision about when to upgrade to a newer printer.

You should also keep in mind that many printers will [accept a selection of compatible cartridge](https://www.tomatoink.com/)s above and beyond the initial cartridge line produced by the manufacturer of the printer. These are often an excellent resource for extending the life of a printer to its maximum and getting the most value for your money.

Finally, to help ensure that your printer remains in working order and that use causes as little damage as possible, you may want to consider using [remanufactured cartridges ](https://www.tomatoink.com/environmentally-friendly-green-ink-and-toner-cartridges)instead of only standard ones. Nowadays, many cartridges are designed to be easily refilled with ink, and that's a positive for consumers...Though, at times, the cost of the ink can be higher than the cost of just buying a new cartridge, depending on how much of a markup is involved. Remanufactured cartridges follow a similar theory, but add in a professional inspection of the entire cartridge, including a complete disassemble of the cartridge and replacement of any damaged parts before the cartridge is filled with ink again. This helps to ensure that the cartridge is as close to new as possible and ready for use for however many more pages the cartridge is intended to last. Even fairly late in the cycle, an order for remanufacturing the cartridge can help to provide a steady number of cartridges for your business to use.

Now that you know a few ways to extend the life of your printer, carefully decide between them. Each business has its own needs for printing and its own desires for getting things done, so there's no one correct solution that you should feel the need to follow. Instead, just carefully evaluate the needs of your business and ask how many cartridges you'll need. In fact, if you don't print very often, you may find it most cost-effective to just buy a number of cartridges at the same time as the printer and keep them in storage, then replace the printer when they're gone.Subscribe here and get the best deals for ink replacements in your email

Every year, the US and many other countries observe what is commonly known as Earth Day. This is a good thing, but helping to protect the environment should be a daily practice. This applies to the average consumer as much as it does to big Fortune 500 companies. As a public service, we would like to share some ideas we believe anyone can put to use to help protect the environment as well as help you save money in the process, especially when it comes to your printing costs and printer ink cartridge costs.Whether you believe in global warming or not, it is hard to debate the fact that auto and truck emissions are at an all-time high, and continue to increase as more countries produce and sell more vehicles. Reducing emissions is one way we can all help to protect the air quality of our respective locations and global air quality overall. Consider a carpool or using mass transit when possible. Walking, when appropriate, rather than driving is also a good way to help reduce carbon emissions.

Save paper and save money! Some studies suggest that the average office can print as many as 10,000 sheets of paper per year, with many offices printing more than that! One very effective idea that many companies are using to reduce their paper needs (and saving a lot of money in the process) is to print on both sides of the paper, rather than just one side. While this is not always practical, it is often a workable idea.

To save money on your ink jet cartridges or other types of printer inks, consider using draft mode when printing nonessential documents. Also, consider using less color ink when possible. This helps to reduce the number of cartridges you will go through in any given year and that can add up to real savings.

Consider starting a recycling program at the office or home. Paper, plastic, cardboard, glass, ink[ toner cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) can all be recycled and that keeps these items out of overused landfills.

Another great way to save money when it comes to inkjet cartridges is to consider buying refurbished toner cartridges. As long as you buy from a reputable company, the printer cartridges that you get will be of the same quality as brand new ink cartridges. The main benefit to the environment is that new materials will not have to be used as the old material is refurbished as much as possible. The other benefit is that purchasing refurbished ink cartridges is much less expensive than buying new cartridges. In some cases, the savings can be dramatic, and if you are getting the same level of quality, why wouldn't you buy refurbished ink cartridges?

Instituting any, or all, of the above can and will save you money, regardless of whether we are talking about a home or office. These ideas are simple to put into action, and they truly do work when it comes to helping the environment, not just locally, but globally. Give it some thought and take action.

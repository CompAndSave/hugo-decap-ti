Many of us find the winter months challenging both mentally and physically, and no wonder! The combination of dropping temperatures, reduced physical activity levels, and diminished daylight hours is enough to dampen anyone's mood. So as the hustle and bustle of the holiday season fades into the slow, dark months of January, February, and March, we find ourselves increasingly struggling to combat colds, flu, and the dreaded winter blues.

## Stay Healthy and Beat the Winter Blues with These Natural Remedies

We've compiled some effective, natural ways to help you remain healthy this winter, both inside and out.

Let's start by addressing our physical health.

## **Cold and Flu Season**

We don't quite know why incidences of colds and flu spike so sharply in winter, but [one explanation](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-we-get-the-flu-mos/) suggests that it's due to how these illnesses are spread. During cold, wet months we find ourselves gathered together in closer proximity. And, because the flu is spread through aerosol infection (e.g., people sneezing or coughing), we're more likely to be infected during winter than we would in warmer months when we're more spread out.

Many people protect themselves by getting an annual flu shot, but if you forgot or just got the flu anyway, there are some natural ways to ease your suffering.

Start by brewing this homemade tea that will help boost your immune system and soothe your sore throat.

### Magic Tea for Colds and Flu

Bring 4-6 cups of water to a boil in a saucepan, and then add:

* 1/2 a lemon, thinly sliced
* 1 tbsp honey
* 1 clove garlic, sliced, minced, or crushed
* 2 tsp grated ginger
* A pinch of cayenne pepper

Let simmer for 15 minutes, adjust ingredients to taste, and enjoy!

Each ingredient in this tea plays a specific role in easing the symptoms of cold and flu and working to combat the illness itself. Ginger aids in digestion, garlic is a powerful antifungal, lemon juice helps cleanse and purify your body, honey coats and soothes sore throats, and cayenne pepper helps to move mucus and ease headache pains. Plus, it's actually quite tasty!

After the tea, run yourself a hot bath and add 1-2 cups of Epsom salts and a few drops of eucalyptus essential oil.

Epsom salts are made up of magnesium sulfate, which works to help relax sore muscles, and eucalyptus clears clogged sinuses.

## **Physical Activity**

Once you've nursed yourself back to good health with teas and warm baths, it's time to make sure you stay that way!

Naturally, your outdoor time decreases in winter but that doesn't mean physical activity needs to decrease a well. Too much sedentary time indoors means your body isn't getting the exercise it needs to stay healthy and tired at the end of the day.

Consider joining a class like yoga, kickboxing, or swimming during the winter months. Many recreation centers have three-month sessions beginning in January, and they're the perfect way to keep you active and ease you throughout the winter doldrums. (Also, consider asking for these classes as a Christmas gift next year — [giving experiences](https://www.tomatoink.com/blog/posts/green-christmas.html) is a great way to reduce physical clutter while getting something you'll actually use!)

Physical activity does far more than prevent winter weight gain, improve physical health, and relieve cabin fever. Getting your body moving can also be beneficial in boosting your mental health, too—ideal for avoiding the winter blues.

## **Mental Health**

The Harvard Health Publication [explains](http://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/exercise-and-depression-report-excerpt) that "… exercise enhances the action of endorphins, chemicals that circulate throughout the body. Endorphins improve natural immunity and reduce the perception of pain. They may also serve to improve mood. Another theory is that exercise stimulates the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which may directly improve mood."

So, that yoga class can help boost your mood and aid in combating winter blues, as well as being a great workout. A win-win for you!

Many physicians also recommend taking Vitamin D supplements during the winter months to improve your mood and mental health. We get fewer sunlight hours throughout the winter and are outside less to take advantage of the sun's natural Vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency is thought to be a major factor in Seasonal Affective Disorder, a depression commonly experienced in winter. Taking a vitamin supplement is a simple, natural way to keep your smile as strong as your body.

Finally, remember that winter doesn't last forever. In a few months, you'll be lounging in shorts, sweating and wishing for some cooler weather. In the meantime, however, these simple, natural tips will help you get through the cold and dreary times.

**The Little Things Can Let You Know What Kind Of Company Your Dealing With**

The merging of the real world and cyberspace has never been in greater harmony than it is now; in quite a few cities, you can order an ink or laser toner cartridge, like the Compatible Samsung SCX-4521D3 toner cartridge, and have the cartridge at your place of business in a day or two. In some areas, same day delivery will soon be routine.

To build an infrastructure like this is not easy - it takes experience in building both a web based presence that is easy to navigate and buy on, and a brick and mortar operation that can deliver the goods.. The quality of the operation will show in how well those two parts of the operation are.  
  
**Don't Be Fooled By a Slick Website with Nothing behind It**

The customer, in the end, does not ask for much, but it is the small things that matter. When the owners of a company realize this it is the sign of a good company. Pay close attention to the testimonials and customer ratings, both on their website and at other places on the web - they are easy to find, and are a good indicator of how well the company performs. Good companies who are intent on customer satisfaction will most likely have been around for five years or more, so inquire about the history of whatever company you are going to be doing business with.

Someone in it for the money, who perhaps just bought a warehouse with a bunch of old cartridges in it doesn't think about the huge inventory a legitimate reseller of ink cartridges has to keep in this field. Ink cartridges which are not so easy to find, like the replacement for Dell M4640 series cartridges should be in stock all the time, as well as many hundreds of other models.  
![dell cartridges](/blog/images/archive/2012/09/dell-cartridges-632x259.jpg)It is not a business for the faint of heart; it is a business for the meticulous, the exacting and the dedicated. Good companies who take pride in what they do will shine through - find the best customer service and the best price, and you won't look back.

Combining shipping and warehousing must also be done with a very fine attention to detail so that orders are filled on the same day whenever possible. The modern world of hi speed internet connectivity makes it possible for someone to place an order an 4:40 and have their package ship the same night, with the customer getting email notifications and tracking numbers.

Sellers of inkjet cartridges and other printer and [toner cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) will only offer this type of supply - it is a bad thing when a retailer who carries a huge range of other products tries to sell printer cartridges as well.

Shipping and warranty terms should be spelled out in plain language, and good resellers almost always offer same day shipping if an order is placed early enough. With a little research you can find a great place to buy compatible ink cartridges and save a ton of money, all without sacrificing quality.

It is no secret that many of the most popular and well-known ink cartridge producers lose millions in sales each year as counterfeit products hit the streets. It is also no secret that counterfeit ink jet cartridges and ink toner products are sold all over the globe. The problem is much bigger than many people assume. But, some countries are starting to fight back.

It was recently announced that police forces in the UAE are making great progress in stopping counterfeit ink cartridges from being sold there. A recent bust prevented criminals from selling a variety of counterfeit HP ink cartridges products. In 2012 alone, the Dubai Police have been able to seize an estimated 500,000 counterfeit ink cartridges and ink toner products. According to HP anti-counterfeit program manager Tina Rose, of the nations located in the Middle East and Africa, the largest number of counterfeit HP products that have seized has occurred in Emirates.

Reports estimate that the total number of counterfeit [ink cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) that have been collected within the UAE since 2011 totals more than two million products. What may surprise some people is that this number represents only counterfeit HP ink cartridges and does not include other brands that are also being faked and sold within the UAE.

Because of the nature of this type of crime, it is all but impossible to get accurate numbers that represent the full picture of how many counterfeit ink cartridges and toners are being sold worldwide. If one considers that 2 million HP counterfeit products were seized in the UAE during 2011, it is reasonable to presume that the global number of counterfeit ink cartridges being moved is in the billions. At this level, it is no wonder that most of the better known ink jet cartridge producers are working hard to curb and prevent their products from being faked and sold and are putting into place aggressive policies (on a global basis) to help them find and prosecute counterfeit vendors.

If one presumes that the number of fake ink cartridges being sold around the world is close to a billion, then it is easy for one to see just how much money is lost to producers such as HP. The amount of revenue lost is simply staggering, and, of course, ink printer cartridge producers want to stop this type of illegal activity. The good news is that many police authorities are now spending considerably more time and energy in tracking down those who are producing counterfeit products as well as tracking down those who sell those products. With more arrests, seizures, and prosecutions, it is hoped that the lure of selling counterfeit ink products will decrease over time.

It is also hoped that more nations around the globe will begin to see the benefit of stopping counterfeit ink cartridge sales in their locales as doing so will have a positive impact on their own economies. HP has already said that because of the UAE's police action, they (HP) are much more willing to work within that area of the world, and this is a positive step for all those involved.

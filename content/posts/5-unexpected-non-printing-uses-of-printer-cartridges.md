**Eco-friendly Upcycling for Printer Cartridges**  
In keeping with our constantly ongoing endeavors to make a positive difference to the ecology we, like to think that there is life for an ink cartridge beyond mere printing.

**1\. Every part of a used ink cartridge can be useful** – An empty cartridge can hold pencils and other stationery on your desk. You can use it as a divider, to separate pens, pencils, and markers. Wrap it first with decorative paper and then use hot glue to the stationery box. You can use the casing of the cartridge as a plant starter. More often than not, there is a little residual ink left over in the cartridge; you can use this for kid's craft or painting projects.

**2\. As furniture in a doll house** – You can paint the cartridges, cover them with paper or get creative with bits of cloth and transform them into miniature tables, stools, chairs, beds or maybe a fridge!

**3\. Use them as beads for your artwork** – Empty cartridges can be used to sort and separate beads. You can do the same with buttons, sequins, ribbons, laces and any kind of craft work materials.

**4\. Lamps /desk lamps** – You could stack up used cartridges to make a desk lamp. You could even fit them together in a circular formation to make a ceiling suspended lamp shade and paint them in fun, bright colors.

**5\. The ink cartridge wind chime** – String the used cartridges and printer drums together for a cheap and cheerful wind chime!

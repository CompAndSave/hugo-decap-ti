Do you keep your home and property safe for your four-legged family members? Do you purchase eco-friendly pet products? Maybe you already do. Or maybe you'd like to but aren't sure where to begin or why it's necessary.

Beyond the well-known chocolate bar, many of the items we use around our homes are toxic to our pets. It turns out that many products that are made specifically for pets may also contain ingredients that could harm them. Here are some tips for which eco-friendly pet products to use and how to keep your pet safer from toxins.

## Use These Eco-Friendly Pet Products to Keep Your Pet Safe

## **Outdoors**

Pesticides that are commonly sprayed on lawns, on trees, and in gardens can easily get onto your dog's coat and into your dog's bloodstream. Pesticides are specifically designed to kill insects and weeds, so it should be obvious that they can do harm to larger animals as well. For example, dogs that are exposed to lawn care chemicals have a higher [risk](http://www.purdue.edu/uns/html4ever/2004/040419.Glickman.scotties.html) of developing bladder cancer. One [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3267855/) showed that exposure to lawn pesticides raised the risk of a dog having malignant lymphoma by as much as 70 percent.

Keep in mind that when you or your child then cuddle up with your pet, those toxins may be transferred to you too. They can also be tracked inside your home putting the toxic chemicals on your floors and furniture.

So what can you do? First of all, you can stop chemically treating your gardens, lawns, and trees. If the weeds are bothering you, pull them by hand rather than spraying them to death. You can also apply essential oils that simply repel insects without harming the earth or your pet. There are many excellent organic options on store shelves that can help to keep your property looking great.

If you hire a lawn or tree company to spray your property, talk to them about the products they are using and the potential risk to your pets. Today there are many natural lawn and tree companies popping up around the country that provide a great alternative to toxic pesticides without harm to your pet or to the environment.

If you do continue to apply pesticides, be sure to remove your pets from the area beforehand. That goes for all toys and bones too. After application, keep pets indoors until the pesticide is completely dry. Some products and professional sprayers will recommend keeping pets off the treated area for up to 24 hours or longer to reduce danger from contact. Though studies have [found that](https://vet.purdue.edu/pcop/herbicide-research.php) the chemicals are typically still present more than 48 hours after application.

## **Indoors**

The same theory goes for those times when there are insects or rodents inside your home. Insecticides are designed to kill insects and can also potentially harm your family pet. Also, many pesticide baits are made with food ingredients that can be attractive, but poisonous, to your pet. Additionally, if your pet decides to pick up poisoned prey in his or her mouth, that poison can be transferred to your pet.

Instead, look for natural alternatives to insecticides, such as essential oils, for use inside your home.

If you do use a chemical insecticide, be sure to remove not only your pet from the area of application, but also the toys, bones, food, water, and any bedding away from the areas of application. You may want to avoid the area for a while too, by the way.

## **Food**

Just like pesticides sprayed on lawns, pesticides sprayed on farms get into our bodies from the food we eat. That goes for pets too. Choosing organic instead helps to lessen that toxic burden on our bodies and our pets. Ultimately, when you read a pet food label, you want to know for certain what is inside. The main ingredients are always listed first, so start there. Look for nutritious ingredients with no artificial colors or preservatives, and no fillers. Preferably you want items that contain no antibiotics, pesticides, herbicides, or GMOs. Not only are those products the most eco-friendly, they are also the ones that will be the strongest contenders for keeping your pet healthy.

## **Flea Collars**

Believe it or not, [flea collars](https://www.organicauthority.com/energetic-health/22-toxic-products-that-pet-stores-need-to-ditch) meant to protect your pet are actually one of the biggest dangers for pesticide exposure. They often include toxins such as tetrachlorinphos, propoxur, and amitraz, all of which are known as possible carcinogens.

Regularly bathe and comb your pets as well as their living areas to keep them from pest infestation. There are also several excellent natural essential oil products on the market, which you can apply before and after taking your pet outdoors.

If you do purchase a flea collar, look for an organic or all-natural alternative for your pet. It may be a few dollars more upfront but could save you in both money and hardship later on if your dog gets sick from the toxin exposure.

## **Dog Waste Bags**

Many people carry grocery shopping bags for picking up their dog's waste. Keep in mind that these bags can sit in landfills for up to 20 years. Instead, look for poop bags that are made from biodegradable plastic. They are strong material, much better for the environment, and won't be around two decades from now!

## **Eco-Friendly Brands**

Understandably, all this talk of making your pet care more eco-friendly might be a little overwhelming. That's why we're starting you off with a list of 12 eco-friendly brands that you may find helpful.

Always seek out the safest alternatives and the most eco-friendly pet products for your four-legged loved ones.

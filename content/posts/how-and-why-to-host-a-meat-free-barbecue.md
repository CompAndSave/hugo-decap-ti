Many thoughts come to mind when BBQ season rolls around each summer — but meat-free barbecue options aren't typically among them. Barbecues seem to shout out for sizzling sirloins and charbroiled burgers, so how (and why) should you plan a meat-free get together?

First, the why. Although it seems like every expert has a different opinion about the role meat should play in an optimal diet, whether you're vegan or paleo, there are countless environmental benefits to eating a meat-free or meat-reduced diet.

Raising beef cattle [requires](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/21/giving-up-beef-reduce-carbon-footprint-more-than-cars) the use of 160 times more land and causes 11 times more greenhouse gas emissions when compared to crops like wheat, potatoes, or rice. This drastic difference means that a vegetarian produces [almost half](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/meat-and-environment/) of the carbon emissions that a meat eater does.

But hey, don't think that you need to give up meat completely! Even reducing your meat intake by around one burger a week can have the same environmental impact as taking your car off the road for 320 miles a year.

So, whether your motivation to reduce meat consumption is based on health or environmental benefit, a meat-free barbecue is a great idea. But, um, what exactly do you serve your guests if you're not cooking meat?

We've got you covered! Here are some fantastic ideas sure to get your mouth watering.

# Mouthwatering Meat-Free Barbecue Options

### **1\. Serve Substitutes**

Yup, we're talking veggie dogs, veggie burgers, and even meatless sausages. Meat substitutes have come a long way in the past few years as the demand for meat-free options has grown. Most supermarkets now stock a wide array of vegetarian alternatives for all your old BBQ favorites.

Grill them the same way you would their conventional cousins, load ‘em up with your favorite condiments, and enjoy! You'll be in (meat-free) barbecue heaven in no time.

### **2\. …Or Not**

For some (die-hard meat-eaters, in particular) meat substitutes, no matter how delicious, just can't compare to the real thing. So instead of trying to recreate an old favorite with less-than-perfect results, why not go a different direction altogether?

There's no reason hot dogs and hamburgers are the only things that should touch your grill this summer — get creative!

Below are some of my favorite options for deliciously different grilled veggie eats.

[Grilled Caesar salad](http://www.food.com/recipe/grilled-caesar-salad-grilled-romaine-362450%20): It sounds strange, but my sister made this dish a few years ago, and it's been a favorite ever since! Grilling whole romaine leaves makes some of the edges crispy while the center stays nice and fresh. Just toss whole romaine leaves in Caesar dressing, season with salt and pepper, and grill for a minute or two per side. Top with croutons, fresh parmesan cheese, and a bit of fresh lemon juice for an incredible side dish your guests will be talking about all week.

Veggie skewers with halloumi: Halloumi is an unripened, brined cheese with a really high melting point, which is why it's sometimes called the grilling cheese. Halloumi will soften on the BBQ and develop a crisp outer layer, but it won't melt all over the grill. Creating colorful skewers filled with your favorite fresh veggies mixed with cubes of halloumi makes for a delicious, cheesy meal.

[Grilled artichokes](http://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/recipes/a35722/grilled-artichokes-harissa-honey-dip-recipe-clx0514/?click=recipe%5Fsr): This recipe involves a bit of prep work to get the artichokes ready for the grill, but believe me, it's well worth it!

### **3\. Don't Forget Dessert**

Don't turn the grill off after dinner! Although ice cream cones are always a classic summer dessert, you can also pop something sweet on the grill to finish the meal. [Grilled peaches](http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/grilled-peaches-with-vanilla-ice-cream) are absolutely sublime, as is [grilled pineapple](http://www.marthastewart.com/341209/grilled-pineapple-with-coconut-sorbet?czone=food/best-grilling-recipes/side-dishes-and-desserts&center=276943&gallery=274828&slide=282675/).

If you think outside the box, it's surprisingly easy to host a delicious meat-free barbecue featuring unique dishes and complex flavors, and never feel like you're missing a thing.

Summer is here! For many of us, *this* is the most wonderful time of the year. Though working out in the summer sure can be rough. When you feel like you're melting the moment you walk out the door, it's not easy to stay focused on being eco-friendly, healthy, or even getting the most from your fitness routine. Try following these tips for exercising in hot weather.

# Here Are Our Top 12 Tips for Working Out in the Summer Heat

1. Drink from glass, not plastic. What you need to know about your BPA-free water bottle is that BPA-free doesn't necessarily mean safe. When they took out the BPA, they had to replace it with something, right? And when that plastic bottle has been in extreme temperatures? Yuck. When you buy a glass water bottle, it's made from glass, and that's it. Choose glass water bottles such as the ones from [Lifefactory](https://www.lifefactory.com/).
2. Watch that your "moisture wicking" fabrics aren't made with toxic chemicals. Sweat and friction, particularly in intense heat, could generate more rapid absorption of toxins into the body. A Greenpeace [report](http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/toxics/2014/Detox-Football-Report.pdf) found that items from most major sportswear companies contained known toxic chemicals, such as: phthalates, PFCs, dimethylformamide, nonylphenol ethoxylates, and nonylphenols. An article in *[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/02/toxics-apparel-nike-adidas-reach)* noted that public health advocates in Europe are becoming increasingly concerned about chemical safety, as "evidence shows a possible link between sportswear and health issues such as cancer, obesity and developmental disabilities." Shop ethical brands such as Alternative Apparel, LVR, Patagonia, Prana, and PACT.
3. Exercise early or late in the day rather than mid-day when the sun is out. Why start your workout during the hottest time of the day? Choose dusk instead.
4. Of course, always wear sunscreen no matter what time of day you're working out in the summer. Look for brands that are reef safe, biodegradable, and free of parabens, phthalates, and other toxins. Some good ones are made by Alba Botanica, Goddess Garden, and Badger.
5. While you're at it, try walking or running in shady and tree-lined areas whenever possible to get relief from the sun's rays.
6. Work out with a buddy, so you can keep an eye on one another. Plus, making your workouts more fun will distract your from the intense heat!
7. Don't forget about the pool. Swim, walk, or do water aerobics to keep your body temperature steady.
8. Stay hydrated. Drinking plenty of water is important all year round. But working out in summer means you need to replenish the extra loss of fluids even more so to keep your body working properly. Additionally, your internal body temperature increases during exercise, and water is responsible for carrying that heat away from your heart. That water becomes sweat. Make sure you are drinking water throughout the day so that your body can maintain a safe body temperature during workouts.
9. Lighten up on spicy foods. Have you ever eaten super spicy mustard or peppers and you start to sweat? It really [does](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub%5Freleases/2008-08/asfb-hpr080608.php) happen that spicier foods can increase your body temperature. Why make yourself warmer than necessary? Instead, simply lay off the chili until autumn.
10. Take a probiotic. Your digestive system is responsible for converting food into energy. And of course you need extra energy to exercise on those hot summer days. Keep your digestive system strong with a good probiotic such as [this one](https://www.nowfoods.com/supplements/probiotic-10-50-billion-veg-capsules).
11. Meditate. (Yes, seriously.) Research has shown that it is [possible](http://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=130031&CultureCode=en) for core body temperature to be controlled by the brain using certain meditation.
12. Certain types of medication (such as insulin) [may increase](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub%5Freleases/2009-11/sri-srs111909.php) the risk of heat-related illness. If you are on medication, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

You too can still enjoy working out in the summer as long as you take a few simple precautions. As they say, some really do like it hot.

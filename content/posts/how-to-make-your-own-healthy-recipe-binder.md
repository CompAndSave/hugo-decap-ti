![diy recipe book](/blog/images/archive/2015/08/ti-08-11-2015-300x600.jpg)For those of us who have the time, cooking can be enjoyable and even therapeutic! Cooking at home helps you eat healthier since you have better control over the ingredients the way your meal is made. Plus, you can tailor your meals to suite your own tastes and special diet. We would love to share with you ways to eat healthy and organize nutritious recipes.

### **Take a Step Towards a Healthy Change**

Though we may be young at heart, sometimes our body reminds us we aren't exactly 21 anymore. We encounter more medical conditions as time wears on. For example, heartburn with old favorite spicy foods! When that happens, it might be time to change your eating habits for your digestive system. Some of us could also be on medications for hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol or heart issues, etc. All these conditions should be taken into account to prevent medication interacting with food choices.

In general you should aim for:

* A higher proportion of (preferably fresh) fruit and veggies in the diet
* Plenty of roughage (dietary fiber such as salads, whole grains, whole fruit etc)
* Smaller portions of everything
* Lower amounts of salt in everything and also fewer packaged/canned foods which are typically laden with sodium and preservatives
* Smaller but perhaps more frequent meals
* Plenty of water
* Healthy fats from fatty fish, nuts and seeds,
* Some additional low fat dairy to replenish calcium stores of the body
* Perhaps some B12 fortified foods (or a supplement) added to the diet

### **DIY Project: Organize Your Recipes In Binder**

ones you no longer use or don't do well with your diet. Then organize them under tabs like: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks, Starters, Salads, Soups, Smoothies, etc. Consider putting each recipe printout in a plastic sleeve (easy to wipe off cooking spills).

Use a giant binder if you have one! This will make it easier when your collection starts building up. If you have lots of recipes you may need more binders or files. Tip: Use post-its or labels to indicate different segments or contents to easily find what you're looking for.

## Save up to 80% on Ink and Toner

Not everyone is focused on buying ink when they visit our website, and if you're one of them, you may be interested in the affiliate program now offered by [TomatoInk](https://www.tomatoink.com/). In modern times, most people have access to at least one printer, especially at the place where they work. Many more people have at least one printer in their house, and the thing that brings them all together is a regular need for ink. Of course, different people have different paces for purchasing ink, and we understand those needs. In fact, that's part of the reason why we offer such an extended return time for each of our products; some people may go for months before even opening a cartridge box, and when they do, they should be able to return it if there are any defects.

Ask anyone and they will say that printers are among the most important and essential office tools seen in any size company. Printers can be found everywhere these days; in schools, homes, and, of course, in businesses. They can be used for a variety of purposes including printing text, projects, reports, graphics and even pictures. Best of all, the prices for even high-quality printers has dropped over the years, making them very affordable. But no printer is worth anything if it does not print well and that is where your inkjet cartridge or toner cartridge comes into play.Inkjet cartridges are widely available now, and can be found at different prices. In some cases, though, the replacement ink cartridge can cost more than the printer! It is important to understand that different types of printers use specific types of cartridges. For this reason, it is important to always get the right cartridge for your printer. The best way to do this is to use the identification numbers that are always found on ink cartridges. Keep in mind that some printers use more than one cartridge.

You should also know that OEM cartridges stand for Original Equipment Manufacturers cartridges. These are almost always more expensive and come from brand name companies such as Epson, Dell, Brother, Canon and so forth. They deliver high-quality results but at a high price, as mentioned above. For large print runs, they can be just too expensive to use.

Another option is unbranded cartridges which are far less expensive and can be found both online and offline at many office supply stores. Make sure you get a compatible inkjet cartridge for your printer. Better units can deliver good print-out quality and they are cost effective so they work well with large runs. Try to buy the best one possible as ink quality does vary.

You can also refill your [inkjet cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) if you are so inclined. This requires buying a refill kit and carefully following its instructions. Again, make sure you get a good quality ink for the best results. Ink is normally found in either pigment based or dye based formulas.

Another excellent option is to buy refurbished inkjet cartridges from online suppliers. These units are just as reliable as new units, but they can be purchased for a fraction of what a new unit might cost. Online vendors offer a wide variety of units so finding the right product for your printer or printing task is usually very easy and fast. However, you still need to get the right type of cartridge for your printer or it will not fit or work properly. If you are not sure what type of cartridge to get, ask the online vendor for assistance. Most quality vendors have a page where customers can ask questions or get in contact with a service representative.

Don't spend more than you have to when it comes to getting new cartridges. Do some comparative shopping and save big and keep your printing jobs looking nice and crisp at a fraction of what it might cost otherwise.

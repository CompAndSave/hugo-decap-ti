![energy-efficient](/blog/images/archive/2016/05/colourbox4124723_low.jpg)If you print often, you know just how much waste you can produce over time between paper and cartridges. However, there are some really great [eco-friendly](https://www.tomatoink.com/blog/posts/eco-friendly-technology-trends-2016.html) options on the market right now. When you choose to buy an energy efficient printer, you are not only helping to save the environment, but you are also saving yourself money! How can you tell if a printer is up to these standards? Here are some things to look for when searching for your next eco-friendly printer:

* **Is it ENERGY STAR Qualified?** If so, this means the printer has been awarded the trusted, government backed label for energy efficiency.
* **Does it have a sleep mode?** Printers with a sleep mode will transition into the mode automatically when not in use, which conserves energy.
* **Duplex Printing?** Duplex printing allows you to print on both sides of a sheet of paper. This will help to cut paper costs and save valuable storage space.
* **Separate Toner and Drum?** Separate systems allow you to replace one without having to replace the other if you run into problems, saving you money in the long run.
* **High Yield Ink and Toner Options** \- High yield ink and toner cartridges can produce almost 3 times as many pages as standard yield cartridges. This cuts your cost per sheet and results in less cartridge waste.
* **Separate Ink Cartridges**\- Having separate compartments for each color is a big win when it comes to replacing cartridges. With multi-ink cartridges, you only have to replace the color you need.
* **Toner Save Mode** \- Turning on this mode uses fewer resources and conserves energy by decreasing the resolution and cutting the DPI (dots per inch) in half.
* **N-Printing** \- This feature allows for printing multiple documents on the same page.

Check out these Energy Star qualified printers that may be just what you're looking for:

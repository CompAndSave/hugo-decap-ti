Did you know it's possible to use eco-friendly printers for printing? In this post we tell you all about green printers, about what makes them green, and the choices you should make if you're planning to buy a printer this year.

#### What Makes a Printer Eco-Friendly?

A printer that saves you money _and_ is good for your wellbeing is also most likely to be one that has the least negative impact on the environment. We recommend picking high yield printers, they give you more printouts per ink or toner cartridges being used. So if you're getting more page printouts per cartridge that means fewer empty cartridges reaching landfills.

Energy efficient printers are also eco friendly because they help lower your carbon footprint as well as your electric bills. When you compare inkjet printers to laser printers, inkjets usually use less energy than laser printers. Keep this in mind when purchasing your next printer.Another tip for picking an eco-friendly printer are ones that print on both sides of the page. That is because they letter paper by default which lets you prevent unnecessary paper waste. Other great tips:

* Use eco-friendly paper (recycled paper is a good option)
* Format your papers in smaller margins
* Print on both sides of the page
* Pick fonts that use less ink
* **Above all: Don't print unless you have to**

### Pick the Right Ink & Toner Cartridges

Remanufactured inks are a good idea environmentally speaking. These cartridges are made by recycling used ones; by checking them for integrity and refilling them.

Many advances in technology such as computers, Internet access, and broadband services have made it possible for many businesses to perform many of their most important tasks in the "virtual" world. In many ways, this has meant more production, faster turnaround times, and less human effort required. It has also meant a great savings, in real dollars, for many businesses. But working in the virtual world can have its drawbacks as well.

While many documents can now be prepared and stored on hard drives, there are some documents that simply should be printed out and kept in a safe location. Spreadsheets, employee records, and tax documents are just three types of documents that should be kept on paper as well as on the business computer or network. There are a couple of good reasons for this.

The first reason for keeping a physical copy of important documents is to protect against loss. Many businesses have (and use) reliable backup systems to ensure that a computer crash will not wipe their documents out completely. Unfortunately, these backup systems are only as good as the system itself and the people who are responsible for running them. Any slip up, at all, could result in a business losing some of its most vital information.

The second reason for keeping physical copies of documents is to prevent possible tampering. It is not uncommon for disgruntled employees to go into a spreadsheet, for instance, and make changes that might harm the company in some way or another. When a company has a copy of its documents that it can use for verification, the company is better protected against this type of harm.

Lastly, some businesses are simply required by law or statue to maintain hard copies of certain documents. These might include safety inspection results, inventory of hazardous materials, or employee complaints. Again, the best way to be protected in this case is to have the required documents on hand.

Valentine's Day is one of those holidays that kind of creeps up on you. If you're a parent, maybe you've been busy getting those little classroom Valentine's Day cards for your kids, but that may be the extent of it. In case you are in need of last-minute Valentine's Day gifts, we've got some fantastic suggestions for you.

## 8 Last-Minute Valentine's Day Gifts

1. **Sticky Note Heart:** Arrange those little [sticky note papers](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/87116574022723870/) in the shape of a heart on a wall or mirror, and on each one write sweet sayings to your loved one.
2. **Heart-Shaped Brownies:** All you need is a box of mix, some eggs, and a heart-shaped cookie cutter! Of course, you also can make [these](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/157555686945005740/) more festive with pink, white, or red icing. Not a brownie fan? You can make heart-shaped blondies or cookies instead!
3. **Scented Cards:** Whether your cards are store bought or handmade, you can make scent in your loved ones' preference or using your own favorites to remind them of you.
4. **Lunch Notes:** Does your loved take a lunch, backpack, or briefcase with them? Chances are the answer to that question is an affirmative yes. Then don't forget to send them off with a Valentine's Day note!
5. **Food Love:** Another way to send your family members or significant other off for the day is to get creative with food. Draw little hearts on the [banana peel](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/128000814389212543/) to let them know that you are bananas for them! In addition to the treats mentioned earlier, you can use that heart-shaped cookie cutter for cucumbers, tea sandwiches, cheese, tortillas, and more!
6. **Scrabble:** Grab your Scrabble board and lay out a mock game filled with words related to Valentine's Day and your loved ones. It's easy, sweet, and if you already have a board, it won't cost you a penny!
7. **Custom Word Search:** Sticking with the game theme of last-minute Valentine's ideas, you can create and print a word search using custom words of your choice using websites like [mywordsearch](https://mywordsearch.com) and [puzzlemaker](http://puzzlemaker.discoveryeducation.com/WordSearchSetupForm.asp).
8. **Wipe Board:** Use your dry erase board to create a love message for your family members or significant other. Do this in conjunction with one of the other suggestions above for an even more effective way of telling someone you love them.

Of course, if those last-minute Valentine's Day gifts don't do the trick, there's always a quick trip to the store for chocolate, flowers, or perhaps a bottle of champagne.

Happy Valentine's Day!

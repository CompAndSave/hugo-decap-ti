Or envisage a master chef demonstrating on a new microwave model how easily you can make a scrumptious pudding in the oven.

But there will always be an ever-present challenge for the [online marketing](https://www.tomatoink.com/) industry. Ecommerce cannot thrive unless ideas do not evolve. And a video has to be evolving at all times.

One of the novel ways adopted by marketers is to invite customers to build brands.

So, how about asking customers to post a short clip of a Hi-definition video they have taken with a newly launched camera â€“ perhaps at a safari? Or a journey through a rugged terrain on a BMX bike?

Yes, there is nothing more exciting than customers themselves validating the products.

Whether you want to build your brand or offer instruction, there is no better vehicle than a video. A DIY manual can clearly show how to fix a tire on to a wheel. Some people may comprehend it. But with a demonstration on a video, they will surely get the point.

For the online marketing industry, the message is clear. Videos are the latest tools to win customers.

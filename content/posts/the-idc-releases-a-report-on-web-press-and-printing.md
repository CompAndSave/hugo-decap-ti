The IDC, or the [International Data Corporation](http://www.idc.com/), recently announced its results for an examination of the internet web press market. According to the reports, the most important players for inkjet are Canon, HP, and Japanese-based Ricoh.(You can get cheap ink cartridges by clicking [here](https://www.tomatoink.com/))

Since the internet was first put online, web printing has rapidly grown to become a major industry. At times, this is only to be expected; major retailers like Amazon typically include receipts with each package they ship, and that's not even counting what it takes to print the shipping labels themselves. When companies may have as many as hundreds of orders per-minute (or more), having completely reliable printers and plenty of supplies is a huge consideration. Equally important are some other web-based factors for printing, including inserts for packages and mail, books that are printed on-demand, and items such as greeting cards or invitations that may end up being sent to a large number of people.

At the very high end of the business, some companies may end up printing literally tens of millions of pages on a monthly basis for their customers. Some of this is for larger documents (a hundred-page book needs only one percent of the orders of a single-page document in order to have the same paper usage), but this volume highlights how important small changes in efficiency can be. As little as half a cent per-page saved can mean millions of dollars not spent on printing costs for the company and, for some, mean the difference between success or failure in the business as a whole.

With the report from the IDC comes some other information for marketers and consumers. Mainly, it's important to have reliable ink cartridges to go along with the printers themselves. Past a certain point, of course, any place that does printing will likely be having many printers running simultaneously in order to keep up with demand. Inkjet has long been found to be a good choice because of its low cost per page and the general printing quality that can be expected for each document. Many documents printed include important information such as how to return a product or the terms of use for the item, where inability to read the document could be problematical or even outright dangerous for the user.

Printing presses and standard printers designed for use with the internet can run some pretty hefty price tags; as the report noted, they may even reach into the multi-million dollar level for the largest and most reliable machines. Considering how big the industry can be, there are companies who can afford to pay this much, and with the price tag comes the expectation of support and future innovation to help drive costs down. The internet market is one of the most competitive in the world, but even here, inkjet is often the printing material of choice. However large or small your business may be, don't be afraid to follow the lead of the best and go for the printing technology that truly meets your needs.Subscribe to our newsletter [and get exclusive deals every month](https://www.tomatoink.com/).

This is the time of year when both spring cleaning and Earth Day tend to overlap. Why not take care of the former with the essence of the latter in mind? Sprucing up your place and cleaning out the old doesn't mean you have to take up landfill space. Instead, breathe new life into household objects otherwise bound for the dump. We've got some inspiring upcycling projects to help you get started with earth-friendly spring cleaning.

## Get Ready for Earth Day with These Easy Upcycling Projects

1\. [Architectural Item Artwork](https://www.hgtv.com/design/rooms/bedrooms/turn-an-architectural-item-into-art)

Need to add a burst of color to your living room or rotate out old artwork for something new? Look no further than items that would otherwise end up in the salvage yard. Tiles, old doors or windows, and wooden planks are just a few items that — with a little TLC — could become gorgeous works of art.

2\. [Upcycled Old Jeans Tic Tac Toe Game](https://acultivatednest.com/10-more-ways-to-re-purpose-old-jeans/)

Every now and then we find some pairs of jeans that are too worn out to donate. Instead of throwing them in the trash, use the material to make a cute game for the kids. It's great for rainy days, show and tell, or a gift to a friend with little ones at home.

3\. [Restyled Colorful Folding Chairs](https://houseandgardendiy.com/)

This super-easy project turns dull and drab folding chairs into beautiful centerpieces. Pick out your favorite fabric prints and an accompanying spray paint color and you're in business. Now, there will be no apologies for bringing out extra seating when company drops by; instead, there will be conversation starters.

4\. [DIY Tin Can Planters with Chalkboard Tags](http://www.homeyohmy.com/diy-copper-tin-can-planters-chalkboard-tags/)

This is a fun project for both kids and anyone who wants to spruce up their balcony or kitchen garden. Upcycle old tin cans into something useful, beautiful, and decorative.

5\. [Upcycled Hardwood Flooring into Shelves](https://www.diynetwork.com/how-to/make-and-decorate/upcycling/how-to-make-shelves-from-old-wood-flooring)

A discerning eye is all that's needed for this project. Whether you're taking some old flooring off the hands of a friend who's undergoing a home remodel or you're visiting the thrift shop, keeping an eye out for unlikely décor candidates can turn up some great finds.

6\. [Colorful Cheese Grater Earring Caddy](https://www.brit.co/grater-caddy/)

This project is an adorable way to turn an old kitchen tool into a repurposed and chic jewelry holder. The ombre effect makes it even more stylish!

7\. [Upcycled Candle Remnants](https://www.happygoluckyblog.com/2011/11/easy-candle-upcycle.html)

A common head-scratcher is what to do with candles that have burned down to the last half inch in their containers. If you, like many others, have a few laying around, you can give these scented centerpieces new life with a votive holder and wicks from a local craft store.

8\. [Mason Jar Toiletry Organizer](https://thediyplaybook.com/2013/04/mason-jar-organizer.html)

This project takes no time at all and adds a homey, farmhouse touch to any room in the house. The organizer is also incredibly versatile: flowers for the entryway, toiletries for the bathroom, utensils for the kitchen — the possibilities are endless.

9\. [Vintage Colander Hanging Planter](http://www.sadieseasongoods.com/no-strain-to-hang-vintage-colander-planter/)

Vintage flair is a quick way to add character and color to your patio garden. Thrift stores are a great spot to find otherwise forgotten and unused colanders that would be very happy to be given new purpose.

10\. TV Stand to Homemade Dog Bed

For the savvier DIY expert, this project yields an amazing transformation. It's customizable to any large TV stand or small dresser that's begging for a makeover. The family pup will be ever-grateful for this one-of-a-kind masterpiece.

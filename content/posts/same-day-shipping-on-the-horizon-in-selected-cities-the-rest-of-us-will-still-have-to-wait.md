**Same Day Shipping Within 3 - 5 Years**

The newest thing that has been showing up in test markets is same day delivery. The trials so far are small with varied types of businesses, but as shipping companies and warehousing facilities get used to the idea and work the inevitable kinks out of the system it is bound to catch on - just one more efficiency in an already extremely efficient supply chain, and one more way in which the phrase 'just in time' really means something in today's world.

Compatible ink cartridge resellers are uniquely positioned to take advantage of this once the logistics of the plan are worked out and the operation is smooth. At some point in time, maybe in just a few years (depending on where you live, of course) you will be able to order [laser toner cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) or printer ink cartridges and have them delivered the same day you ordered. The industry is already known for their good customer service and quick shipping; that part of the experience will only get better as the warehousing and shipping systems  
  
**Customer Service and Shipping Are Good Signs of How Well the Company Is Run**

Of course, the best compatible ink companies will pride themselves on fast, accurate shipping. That is a good indicator of how the rest of the operation is run. As always, saving money is good, but you have to rely on your ink supplier that they know every phase of the manufacturing process and that they state clearly the standards by which their products are manufactured. If they are built to the exacting demands of the OEM products there should e no difference in the products. Making remanufactured ink cartridges and compatible ink cartridges, as well as toner cartridges every bit as good as the OEM cartridges is simply a matter of setting up excellent manufacturing facilities, and this is what the best companies do to ensure the quality of all their products

If you pay attention, talk to the customer service to check the warranty and quality of the product you can save big money and get the same quality as the OEM cartridges. The remanufactured cartridges will be made to the same exacting standards as well, like the remanufactured ink jet cartridge for the Stylus C64 printers, T044120 remanufactured inkjet cartridge. The savings in cartridges like this one can be huge, and the customer service from a good company will go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied.

The original manufacturers of ink and toner cartridges mark up their prices by a huge amount - they have a lot more overhead, and sales of ink does help to make up for the cost of development.

But that does not mean you have to personally pay the cost - if the compatible or remanufactured product has just as good a service and output of the original, and in some cases can cost as little as a tenth of the OEM cartridge, I know what direction I am going to go - at this time of my life, with good service and fast shipping I will opt to save the money.

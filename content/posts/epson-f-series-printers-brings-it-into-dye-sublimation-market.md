It was recently announced that Epson will be entering the dye-sublimation printing arena. This is the company's first move into this expanding marketplace. It will do so with two transfer printers (both dye-sublimation) and roll-fed. They are the 64-inch SureColor F7070 and the smaller 44-inch SureColor F6070.

One of the more impressive aspects of these new [printers](https://www.tomatoink.com/) is that they are the only current dye sublimation printers that are totally manufactured by the same company. Everything from ink to output tray is manufactured by Epson. What this results in is a very high level of outstanding performance that is also very reliable. Both printers are capable of producing at levels that meet industry standards while maintaining superior quality. They have output quality that is as high as 1440 x 720 dpi and this is possible on all of the leading transfer papers that are being used today.

In addition, the new F-Series models are able to fully support a wide range of various applications. These include applications that are used for high-quality signage, different types of sportswear and apparel, various kinds of accessories, and can even be set up for customized promotional items. This might include things like mugs or mouse pads, to name but two. Speed is impressive too with each model able to print as much as 618 sq feet an hour (depending on how it is set up). The ink system consists of a 1.5 liter capacity that is easy to refill.

The dye-sublimation ink used was specially-formulated and took Epson more than three years to develop. It is capable of producing all of its images in vibrant colors that include an intense black. It can also produce sharp contours, as well as smooth, graceful gradations. Consumers will like the fact that this ink has superior fastness when it comes to light and washing. The ink is also resistance to the acid perspiration stains that are common in other types of inks. The new print head that is used on these models ensures that precise and reliable performance is continuous, and boasts of a long life span. It should be noted that these new printers were designed for use with Epson Ultra Chrome DS inks only.[Find ink cartridges for every Epson's printer ](https://www.tomatoink.com/epson-printer-cartridges)

The company has also brought in a new line of transfer papers that can be used for dye-sublimation purposes on the new printer models. The papers allow for high end fabric that are cut and sew. This paper is often used in apparel production. Its multipurpose paper can be used for a whole host of other transfer applications such as used for mouse pads, t-shirts, or mugs and ceramics. Each type of paper uses a special chemical coating. This coating allows users to set heavier ink loads which are needed to create superior color results. They can be found in 328 foot rolls.

The company says that it is excited about this new move into the dye-sublimation market and is very proud of the new printers, ink, and papers that it has been able to produce to support the move. It is their hope that their customers will be able to make more money by using this new technology.

It's that time of year throughout much of the country, when one or two steps outside makes you crave something warm and toasty. So we're bringing you a plethora of hot cocoa recipes to choose from.

## But First a Little History

Hot chocolate has been a source of strength and wellness for thousands of years. Legend has it that people began drinking hot cocoa as far back as 3,000 to 4,000 years ago. It began in Mexico, where cacao plants were first grown. They would ground cacao pieces, mix them with water, and drink them. The Mexican people quickly discovered that this drink gave them energy, and soon it was thought of as sacred. Generations later, when Mexico was conquered by Spain, the drink became popularized in Europe.

Hot cocoa was even used as a remedy for soldiers during the Revolutionary War and for some of this nation's most famous explorers. Though today it is more widely used as a treat than a remedy, hot chocolate has been a favorite in the United States ever since.

Perhaps you still go for the simple hot cocoa recipes that your mom used to make, or maybe you prefer to spice things up a bit. No matter what your taste preference, there's something for everyone on this list of 30 hot cocoa recipes to help you stay warm this winter.

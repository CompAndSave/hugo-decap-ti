A lot of things conduct electricity, but one thing you probably never would have added to that list, is ink. Today, that is no longer true. Specialized modern inks now have an amazing ability, and that is that they can be made to conduct electricity! While the uses of conductive inks right now is limited, though useful, the technology is improving almost daily and it will likely have a big impact on many of the electronic devices that we use in our daily lives.

Conductive inks contain some type of conductive particle, often silver or carbon, which helps them conduct electricity. While silver and carbon are the most common materials used, there are new companies popping up that are pushing the boundaries of the technology and are employing other powdered minerals and even conductive plastics. While conductive inks in and of themselves are a major feet, there are drawbacks. Traditional circuit boards are made with copper wiring and, as of right now, conductive inks have a higher resistance than copper which means that they are not capable of carrying a strong current as efficiently as current technology.

The current uses of conductive inks are varied, including printing circuits on windshield defrosters, printed membranes below keyboards that indicate when a key has been pressed, radio antenna printed on rear car windows, and more. Currently, the main form of printing with conductive inks is through screen printing, a process which leaves a thick layer of ink, though it is generally slow and expensive. More modern conductive inks are being used in offset printing, a much cheaper and faster alternative. Currently, there are applications for toys and other smaller, low cost uses. For example, one company printed tray mats for a fast food chain and a toy that came with a child's meal would light up if the circuit on the mat was followed. While that application may seem trivial to some, it is laying the groundwork for future innovations that could drastically change the way electronics are manufactured.

When the technology is pushed farther and efficiency is increased the cost of producing circuit boards could be drastically reduced. Currently several companies are working with conductive inks to create a wide range of products including some as revolutionary as a computer display that can be printed on paper, allowing it to be rolled up and carried along with the user. These technologies are likely still years away, but their implications are huge. Improvement in circuitry and new ways to create those circuits is likely to change the way we view and use computers and electronic devices of all kinds.

While conductive ink technology is in use today, its heavy influence is still several years off. Though it's not here yet, make no mistake, there are many companies working hard and innovating new uses for this incredible technology. It may not be long before batteries are printed on paper, not the bulky devices we know of now, or our computers can just roll up and fit in our briefcases or purse, or cell phones become credit card thin. Conductive inks can only get better and it is anyone's guess what new wave of electronics will arrive because of their use. It may not even be so farfetched to expect that people may be able to print their own circuits at home using conductive [ink cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/)!In the meanwhile, if you want to receive discounts and deals for your traditional ink cartridges, [subscribe here ](https://www.tomatoink.com/welcome/subscribe)

Think about the last time you replaced your ink or toner cartridges. What did you do with the old ones? 300 million times a year, that answer is toss them. When ink cartridges end up in a landfill, they can take up to 1,000 years to decompose. At that rate, that's almost 400,000 tons worth of waste that will still be around for many generations to come! So what can we do to help [decrease the impact of cartridge waste](https://www.tomatoink.com/environmentally-friendly-green-ink-and-toner-cartridges) on our environment? Choose remanufactured ink cartridges! ![TomatoInk Cartridge](/blog/images/archive/2016/09/ti-product-shot.jpg)

**How Can Remanufactured Cartridges Help the Environment?**

Recycling has been a part of the printer ink cartridge industry for a long time, by way of remanufactured cartridges. In this process, recycled cartridges go through an extensive cleaning process to remove all the ink. Then, they are then recycled and put together to form a fresh new cartridge. Finally, they are filled with the same high quality ink you find in OEM (original equipment manufacturer) cartridges. It is important to note that remanufactured cartridges are not the same as [refillable cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/blog/posts/how-to-refill-your-inkjet-cartridges.html), which can only be filled with new ink at certain locations.

  
**Save Another Kind of Green**

Remanufactured cartridges are great for making a positive impact on the environment, but they can save some green in your wallet as well! Using remanufactured cartridges can [save you 15 to 50%](https://www.tomatoink.com/price-match) when compared to their OEM counterparts. In some cases, remanufactured ink cartridges last longer than generic inks. Not only are remanufactured cartridges recycled, they're more cost efficient!

Using remanufactured cartridges in place of an OEM cartridge is a great way to reduce your office's environmental impact by conserving plastic and giving your printer ink cartridges new life!

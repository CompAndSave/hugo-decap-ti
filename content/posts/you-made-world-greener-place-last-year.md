Colorado and the Amazon became greener last year thanks to our loyal customers! Through our [partnership](https://www.tomatoink.com) with OneTreePlanted, TomatoInk planted roughly 4,000 trees in 2016.

# From Seed to Sprout: Making the World a Greener Place

Brazil, specifically the Amazon, still has the highest area of [forest deforestation](https://www.tomatoink.com/blog/posts/how-to-stop-deforestation.html). But guess what? The United States ranks number seven on that list.

So how can we combat this deforestation? TomatoInk decided to plant trees in these areas to help the forests here at home (Colorado) and in one of the most heavily deforested parts of the world (Amazon).

Here's how it works. You make a purchase on [TomatoInk.com](https://www.tomatoink.com/). We then donate to OneTreePlanted so that they can plant a new tree in Colorado or the Amazon. With your help, we eventually want to plant one million new trees in these regions.

# Your Printing Gets a Little Greener

This partnership enables you to continue printing pages as you normally would because you are replenishing the forests. Plus, TomatoInk's eco-friendly ink and toner cartridges make [printing](https://www.tomatoink.com/environmentally-friendly-green-ink-and-toner-cartridges) even greener.

# A Big Thanks to You

We're delighted that we were able to help plant so many trees last year. And we hope to plant even more in 2017! But all of this wouldn't be possible without youâ€”our faithful customers. Thank you for shopping at [TomatoInk.com](https://www.tomatoink.com/) and making the world a greener place.

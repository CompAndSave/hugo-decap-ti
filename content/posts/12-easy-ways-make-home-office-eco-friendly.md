When there are many major corporations throughout the nation that are not taking their carbon footprint responsibly, it's often easy to forget that the actions of even one person can make a difference. Making your home office eco-friendly, for example, can help save the world from more non-biodegradable material in our landfills, additional wasted electricity, unnecessary reliance on oil, and more, while also saving on your business expenses.

# 12 Ways to Make Your Home Office Eco-Friendly

Let's get this party started, shall we? Here are 12 ways to make your home office eco-friendly:

1. ### Recycle ink & toner cartridges

Of course that would be our #1 tip! Manufacturing just one original equipment manufacturer (OEM) ink cartridge requires up to half a gallon of oil. Now consider that over 350 million cartridges are thrown away each year instead of being recycled. That makes for an incredibly enormous amount of waste. Just imagine how many fewer gallons of oil would be needed if we all [re-used](https://www.tomatoink.com) ink cartridges in our eco-friendly home office instead of purchasing new ones.

As if that weren't reason enough, it takes anywhere from 450 to a whopping 1,000 years for a single ink cartridge to [decompose](https://www.tomatoink.com/blog/posts/how-remanufactured-cartridges-save-some-green.html) in a landfill.

1. ### Purchase recycled printer paper & reusable pens

While we're talking about recycling ink and toner, let's also mention the other office products that should be purchased in recycled form, such as paper, pens, and more. You can now find recycled printer paper at most office supply or big-box stores.

1. ### Use both sides of paper

You can reduce paper usage substantially by printing on both sides of the paper. No matter what you are printing, double-sided is appropriate.

1. ### Use smaller font

If you are printing letters, presentations, or documents, you may be able to save paper and ink by using wider margins and smaller font.

1. ### Get rid of your fax line

Many offices still have fax machines simply because they feel as if they are supposed to have one. But most businesses these days don't have a need for sending documents via fax. See if you can eliminate that extra phone line and unplug your fax machine. Should it be needed at any point, you could always plug it into the phone line for one or two transmissions.

1. ### Open the blinds and curtains

Artificial lighting accounts for a substantial amount of electricity consumption; so let the natural light shine in! Not only will it reduce the need for overhead lighting, it could very well lighten your mood, too! During the winter months the natural light may also help with regulating the temperature in your office space.

1. ### Install better bulbs

Replace those incandescent bulbs in your home office space with compact fluorescent bulbs, which use up to 75 percent less energy and can last up to 10 times longer.

1. ### Install a reversible ceiling fan for year-round use

If your office space has an average ceiling height, consider installing a reversible ceiling fan. A ceiling fan uses significantly less energy than heat or air conditioning systems. It will circulate cooler air in the summer and help to keep warmer air down in the winter.

1. ### Put a waste bin & recycle bins in your office

This is such a simple task and one that will make a difference. When you have a recycle bin in your space, you are more likely to think about what items should go in it. It's a simple energy-saving psychology technique!

1. ### Power down

Make an effort to shut down at the end of the workday. (And we don't just mean mentally.) Turn off computers, printers, lights, heating, and air conditioning units. You can even automate this process by utilizing units that automatically shut down at night.

1. ### Use eco-power strips

This is one way to power down your computers, printers, and other electronics while you're out of the office. Smart power strips reduce electricity usage by shutting down power to products that go into standby mode.

1. ### Fix what's broken

One of the biggest ways that we waste electricity and increase our carbon footprint is by buying new products. In addition to buying reused and recycled items, consider fixing what's broken before simply purchasing a new one, whether it's a piece of furniture, a laptop, or anything in-between.

By taking actions like these to make your home office eco-friendly, you will reduce your carbon footprint and save money in the process!

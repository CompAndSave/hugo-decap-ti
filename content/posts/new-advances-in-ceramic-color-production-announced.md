## Innovations Improving Color Durability and Performance

Not all inkjet printing jobs are done on paper. One particular area of printing that has long waited for major advancements is the ceramic imaging market. Now, Electronics for Imaging, Inc (EFI) has come up with an innovative way of improving ceramic imaging, and they are calling it the EFI Cretaprint® C3 printer.When the C3 printer is incorporated with the Fiery® proServer for Cretaprint, users will find a new world of opportunities when it comes to the ceramic imaging market. The Cretaprint C3 multipurpose digital ceramic decoration printer was designed with over five years of research as well as 15 years of customer feedback.

Some of the major benefits that users find include, the highest quality ceramic printing experience available, more intense colors, increased flexibility, and higher yields. The printer includes an easy to use interface, which allows users to increase productivity as well as profits.

The C 3 is the third generation of digital ceramic printeigital [ceramic printerrs](https://www.tomatoink.com/) from Cretaprint. It is no secret that the tile imaging market is rapidly moving towards digital platforms, and EFI has been leading the pack in this sector. Because of is ease of use and versatility, the C3 is able to help users speed up production lines as well as help them to create new products that offer added value via the many new innovations offered by the printer.

The new unit was designed with a single chassis that is more than capable of accommodating up to eight print bars. These bars are easy to access through a new slide-bar design, and each can be independently configured to handle special printing and decoration needs. The system allows for more than 1,000 customizable settings, and includes print width and speed, all the way up to printer direction and ink discharge. A very special feature is that allows the user to work with different printing heads in the same machine which means users can configure it to do printing with varying inkjet levels of intensity. This allows for more special decoration effects. Best of all, its small, compact size makes it perfect for installation into any size production line with ease.

The optional Fiery server is the first dedicated color management solution that is designed especially for the ceramic market. It will literally redefine the design and production processes that are used for color in the ceramic imaging sector. It can do this by allowing for automated, predictable, and controlled results. The Fiery server works as an effective bridge between the ceramic print production and organic business management solutions. In simple terms, this means less waste, more production, and increased profits because companies will no longer have to endure the trial and error method of finding the right color palette or color management profile.

For those who have been searching for a reliable and affordable ceramic color production solution, this may be the answer. Given the number of years dedicated to its design and testing, the C3 may be the best answer to common problems that ceramic printing companies face everyday.

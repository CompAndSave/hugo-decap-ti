One of the biggest advantages to [buying ink in bulk](https://www.tomatoink.com/) is that you won't have to take nearly as many trips down to the store to pick up some ink, which among other things will save you time, gas, and productive use of your printer. However, even the best online delivery doesn't mean you can totally forget about inventory management. Despite that, following a few basic principles can ensure that your business doesn't run out of ink. Follow the simple steps below to help set things up and ensure you'll have all the ink you need.

To begin with, determine exactly how quickly you move through the ink cartridges that you already have, and keep in mind that unexpected events may increase your rate of consumption. The basic principle of inventory management for buying cartridges online is to have enough time to get the new order shipped and delivered before your current selection runs out. Of course, shipping times may vary depending on how fast you're going.

Here at TomatoInk, most orders will be shipped within twenty-four hours of when the order is received and payment data is confirmed, and will typically go through either the USPS or FedEx. Please keep in mind that particularly large orders may take longer to ship, especially for orders to non-contiguous and APO/FPO locations.

In most cases, orders can be shipped in one day to areas in Oregon and Washington, two days to Idaho, Nevada, Montana, Utah, and California, and rising times the further away the destination is. Most shipments within the United States will arrive within five days (barring unexpected circumstances, flight delays, and other aspects outside of TomatoInk's ability to predict or control). For a better breakdown on how long it will take to ship to your region, [visit us online](https://www.tomatoink.com/) and look for our Shipping Policies. Express shipping (including overnight, two-day, and three-day) options are available within the United States.

Orders outside of the United States may take somewhat longer to fulfill. Depending on the distance, carrier, and various other factors, orders to Canada can take approximately 7-20 days to fulfill. Other countries may have significantly different times, and TomatoInk has partnered with Bongo International to help fulfill orders.

As you can see from these scheduled times, distance from our main facility in Oregon can have a major impact on how quickly we can get your order to you. Generally speaking, it's best to assume longer shipping times rather than shorter ones. Most carriers are actually very good about getting products to you promptly, but it's always best to allow plenty of wiggle room for orders instead of trying to cut it exactly down the line. This is especially true for larger orders which, again, tend to ship slower than smaller, more individual orders.

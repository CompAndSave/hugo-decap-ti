## TomatoInk Saves You Up to 80% On Ink and Toner

TomatoInk is an internet only company that is changing the face of the replacement ink cartridge industry as you know it. For many people when their printer ink cartridges run dry, their only thought was, "Great, now I'll have to spend upwards of $60 to get new ink from \[insert major printer manufacturer here\]." TomatoInk is changing all that by bringing consumers the opportunity to replace their empty cartridges with either new [compatible cartridges or remanufactured cartidges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) at significant savings to them.([Subscribe](https://www.tomatoink.com/welcome/subscribe) to our newsletter to receive deals on your email)

First, let's talk about just how TomatoInk saves you so much money.

Because of this, TomatoInk can offer cartridges at a **savings of up to 70% less than the major brand manufacturers!** Additionally, TomatoInk is an online only company; that means that they don't have the high overhead costs of a brick-and-mortar store that has maintenance, staffing, security, and display costs resulting in the need for higher markups. TomatoInk can bring you the lowest costs because they operate their own business on a cost efficient model! Finally, TomatoInk is physically located in the state of Oregon, one of the only 5 states in the United States which does not have any sales-tax, meaning additional savings for consumers!

Along with great savings, TomatoInk offers convenient, fast shipping, and even offers free shipping with a minimum order. When ordering online there is always the X-factor that is shipping.

Find your skis and snowshoes because it's time for eco-friendly winter vacations! More and more families are choosing to spend a part of their winter holidays on vacation. It's certainly a great way to see new places, celebrate the holidays, and spend the winter as you see fit. Whether that is speeding down slopes on skis, tobogganing down pristine hills (only to climb up to the top again, dragging your toboggan behind you), or simply lazing about in front of the fireside while curled up with hot cocoa and a book, what your winter vacation looks like is entirely up to you.

As I mentioned in a previous post about [summer vacations](https://www.tomatoink.com/blog/posts/5-eco-friendly-destinations-perfect-for-your-summer-vacation.html), tourism is hugely impacted by various things such as global warming, rising sea levels from melting glaciers, desertification, deforestation, and a plethora of things caused by human activity on this planet. We have deeply affected our planet and now we are feeling the impact of what we have done. As the largest growing industry in the world, tourism has to give back to the planet some of what we have taken from it.

Besides all of this, ski resorts impact the earth negatively in an additional way. To keep the slopes covered with snow, resorts use snow-making machines. These machines are a huge drain on the environment, simply based on the amount of water and energy they consume in order to make the snow.

Enter the eco-friendly winter vacation. It is possible — as you saw with the summer vacations post — to visit places that choose to minimize their impact on the planet by making the right choices regarding preservation, using natural resources to power their resorts, and even going toward plant-based options for their restaurants, often growing their own produce in organic gardens close to — or located in — their resorts. Here are five destinations that deserve your attention this winter.

## 5 Eco-Friendly Winter Vacations

Located on the beautiful Mendocino Coast in California, the Stanford Inn is "a special place that enlivens and inspires".

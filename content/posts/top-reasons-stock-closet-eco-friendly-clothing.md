When out at the mall and browsing through the clothing racks, most of us aren't thinking about the carbon footprint of the clothing on the hangers. Yet fashion does leave a clear-cut footprint, with environmental and even potential health hazards. It may not have dawned on us to purchase eco-friendly clothing lines, shoes, and accessories â€” until now. Fortunately, eco-friendly clothing lines are beginning to sprout up at the mall and online too, giving us new opportunities to stock our closets with items that won't harm the environment or ourselves.

# Why Eco-Friendly Clothing Lines Are Sprouting Up Everywhere

Who would've thought that manufacturing a polyester shirt requires large amounts of crude oil, acid gases (such as hydrogen chloride), and volatile organic compounds? Then those solvents and other byproducts used to make that polyester shirt are emitted into the environment and into the water system.

While polyester is a man-made fabric, cotton comes directly from crops. However, this doesn't mean that cotton is necessarily a better alternative. Conventional cotton farming too leaves behind a substantial carbon footprint, and the United States is said to be the [largest](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1964887/) exporter of cotton in the world.

It's time for us to pay more attention to our purchases because our consumer dollars can drive positive changes that could last for generations to come. These new eco-friendly clothing brands are manufacturing and selling sustainable fashions that are rocking catwalks, websites, and shopping malls around the nation. Here's why eco-friendly clothing lines are important, and why we should take notice.

### **Organic Fabrics**

Cotton made with organic fibers is grown without the use of pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, and any other toxic fertilizers. It is also made from cottonseeds that are in their natural state and haven't been genetically modified.

Why is this important? It is estimated that [up to](http://ejfoundation.org/report/deadly-chemicals-cotton) 25% of annual insecticide use is done on traditional cotton, which is higher than any other crop. Five of the top nine pesticides used on cotton are known to be carcinogens. Cotton fertilizers and pesticides may have killed or injured millions of fish, birds, and other wildlife, not to mention the harm it does to people. Additionally, about 75% of the cotton and cottonseed in the United States is genetically modified. Do you really want toxic pesticides in your clothing anyway?

### **Free of Other Toxic Chemicals**

Flame retardants are one such chemical often [found in](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/03/170309141306.htm) clothing that may be doing more harm than good. In fact, children who have more exposure to flame retardant are more likely to exhibit behaviors such as aggression, defiance, hyperactivity, inattention, and bullying.

Conventional clothing grown with toxic chemicals and items made with added chemicals can harm the environment and potentially do damage to our health. Fortunately, both consumers and apparel companies are beginning to take notice.

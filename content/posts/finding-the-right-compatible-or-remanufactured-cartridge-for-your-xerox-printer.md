**Good Infrastructure Equals Good Products**Ordering on the internet and getting your product within a few days is becoming more and more possible as internet technologies, warehousing efficiencies and modern shipping are coming together like never before to get you the products you need as fast as possible. When you order your Compatible Replacement 106R01371 High Yield Black Laser Toner Cartridge for Xerox Phaser 3600 Printer you should expect it to ship within 24 hours, and depending on how far away you live you could see the box within as quick as two days (it still takes a little longer to go all the way across the country, unfortunately).

To do this, a company must develop a well thought out plan and develop an infrastructure that needs to span the internet and real world platforms. It is not an easy thing to set up such an efficient structure, and the fact that a company has gone to the trouble to do that is a direct indicator of how seriously they approach the manufacture of their product.

  
**Don't Be Fooled By a Shallow, Gimmicky Website**

Small businesses can save a lot of money on quality remanufactured and new compatible cartridges, but it is even more important for them that they are assured of the highest quality when ordering these [laser toner cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) than it is for a home consumer. With ink cartridges like the one above you can save well over fifty percent off the OEM cartridge prices and get the same super high output that your business depends on, at the same time you are assured of the super crisp, clean, quality prints that you are accustomed to.

Customer service will be paramount to a quality remanufactured or compatible ink cartridge seller, and they should be able to answer any question that you have about ordering or exactly which cartridge is right for your specific needs.

They should be just as specific about the fact that they are manufacturing these cartridges with strict attention to the mechanical specification of the OEM cartridges, and that the ink formulations are an exact copy to the OEM inks as well. With modern manufacturing this is possible, but it takes a dedicated company to make sure it is done properly - that is why it is so important to pay attention to how good their customer service is, as well as their warranty.

  
**Do They Stand Behind Their Product?**

The warranty on the inkjet printer cartridge or laser toner cartridge is very important - it is an indicator of how much confidence the company has in their own product. If they don't offer a real warranty, or if it is only for 30 days instead of a year that is a real sign that you are dealing with the wrong company. With a one year warranty, it is easy to tell that they have the greatest faith that their product will come to the same standards that you expect from the OEM cartridge which costs so much more. If you find all these things in your inkjet or laser toner cartridge seller, then you can order with confidence, knowing that you will save money and get the same great crisp, clear prints that you need as a small business.

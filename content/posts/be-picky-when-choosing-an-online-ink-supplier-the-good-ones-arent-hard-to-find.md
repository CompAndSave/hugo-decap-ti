**How Easy It Is**

The supplier you choose to get your ink cartridges from can make a big difference in price, quality, available models of ink cartridges and laser toner cartridges, and whether or not their warranty is any good. These things will make all the difference in which supplier you choose. Reputable dealers will have a long track record to judge them by, and there will be no confusion about their warranty language. Also, keep an eye on shipping costs as some resellers pad their profit by overcharging for shipping.

These days, it is easy to get a website; that can be set up in a matter of days, and on first inspection will look good. But with many of these fly by night companies, you will run into glitches and problems as you search through the options to find the ink cartridges that you need. It is a bit harder to turn that site into a place that attracts shopping customers. For the site to be truly successful, it must offer three or four simple things. Ease of navigation and the ability to find the right product through multiple channels is extremely good, and a simple, easy to understand warranty - and with ink cartridges or [laser toner cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/), the longer the warranty the better - some people just do not print very much material, and a one month warranty is very short in terms of printer and laser toner cartridges.

**What to Look For In a Good Supplier**

How fast a company ships and how good their customer service is is a good sign about the overall quality of the company. Before you order, call their customer service and ask for a specific product, like the Brother Compatible LC31Bk and other 31 series cartridges. When you talk to them are they helpful, and do they quickly find the right product that you need? Do they answer all your questions about the product?

The supply side of the compatible ink seller is extremely important. Even the best customer service is no good if the product itself is inferior. That being said, the presence of a good customer service policy usually does mean that the ink and cartridges are well made.

Reverse engineering, state of the art manufacturing facilities and quality control that is every bit as good as the original manufacturers will result in a product that for all intents and purposes is the same as the OEM. When these processes are in place, the entire process is carefully controlled, from the formulation of the inks to the case and print heads. The ink has to be tested to make sure it is has just as brilliant a color, that the light fastness is the same as the OEM and that output equals that of the manufacturers cartridge.

These are the signs of a good online ink seller. Buying toner cartridges, printer ink cartridges and inkjet cartridges from a good compatible ink dealer can save you lots of money and give you the same quality prints that you are used to, with great customer service and the assurance of a good warranty. Saving money has never been easier or better!

It is possible for anyone to encounter printer problems from time to time. There could be poor quality of printouts, drying out of printer heads, paper jams and so on. Let's look at some common printer ink cartridge problems and toner cartridge problems and how you can avoid or resolve them:

## The printer won't print

Firstly, ensure that you have the right type of ink cartridge installed for your printer brand and model. It isn't necessary that you buy expensive OEM or original manufacturer cartridges – **[compatible cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/)** are made to exact printer specifications and work just as well. However, it is necessary that the correct cartridge for the brand and model be used.

Then check to see that the **[ink cartridge](https://www.tomatoink.com/)** or the **[toner cartridge](https://www.tomatoink.com/)** is properly installed and seated/aligned in the correct position. Make sure that all the cables are properly connected and all the requisite software installed. See that the printer trays, doors and so on are in the proper position for printing.

Also, ensure that your printer is not out of paper and that the paper is properly placed in the tray. If there is still a problem, try restarting the system.

## Poor quality printouts

The most obvious cause of this could be that the printer ink cartridge or toner cartridge is exhausted and may need to be replaced. However, there are other reasons why you may not be getting the best quality printouts. Check the following to see what the problem could be:

* Check the print settings – the setting could be "Draft" which may need to be unchecked to get better quality printouts
* Have you not been using your printer regularly in the recent past? If so the print nozzle could be clogged and the printer head could be dry, thereby preventing proper printouts. Use your printer regularly to ensure it is in good working order.
* Follow the recommended cleaning and maintenance procedures as set out in the instructions. Note that different printer brands and models will typically have different maintenance and cleaning instructions, so don't assume that the same instructions will apply for different printers and cartridges.

If you have tried everything and you are still getting poor quality printouts – patchy, lined or faded looking- it could be a simple matter of your printer ink cartridge or toner cartridge being exhausted. Simply replacing the exhausted cartridge with a new one will resolve the problem.

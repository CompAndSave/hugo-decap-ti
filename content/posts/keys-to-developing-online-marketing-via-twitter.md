Online marketing techniques continue to evolve. One of the more current tactics being employed today for online marketing and brand recognition is being used via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tomatoinktoner). Using Twitter as a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) tool has been proven to be an effective way to interact with customers and potential customers. Because of Twitter's popularity it is also a very broad platform that allows companies to reach millions of people, if the CRM goals are established and performed correctly.

Using Twiter as CRM tool is also a great way for companies to increase their marketing efforts and customer service goals at a very affordable price. Twitter is known to be an effective tool, but it does require that a business have a well-crafted strategy in place in order for it to be as effective as possible. Many times, a business may not know what it is getting into when it goes live on Twitter, and this can spell disaster if that company is not prepared and ready to handle the many issues that come alone with being on Twitter.

One of the most common mistakes a business can make when it does online marketing and CRM work via Twitter occurs when the company gets a ton of Tweets, many of which may require some form of response or interaction company personnel, such as through customer service. Most companies understand that social media outlets such as Twitter and Facebook are great venues for showcasing their goods, services, and products, but fail to understand that using these outlets is also a great way to lose customers if their CRM efforts are lacking or absent.

Many of a company's customers will use Twitter as an alternative to using phone or email when it comes to communicating with companies. They use Twitter to ask questions, request additional information, and get the details that they need in order to make a buying decision. What this means to companies that use Twitter is that they have to be prepared, in advance of going live on Twitter, to handle these types of issues. And that is where many companies fall down.

As is true with any type of CRM effort, a strategy is required. But with Twitter, because of its requirement for brief messages, this strategy has to be well-though out. For instance, it is probably not a good idea to use Twitter when trying to respond to a customer's complaint. There simply is not enough room (in terms of text) for a company to respond fully. It is far better to have some way of communicating with that customer (phone or email) than to try to get the problem resolved in a few characters of text.

With this in mind, a company that is preparing its Twitter CRM goals may want to limit itself to using Twitter for certain activities such as marketing, public relations, brand recognition, acquiring new customers, and limited amounts of customer service. When a company has a clear idea of what they want to do on Twitter they can develop solutions to handle any type of challenge that may present itself. Using the old shotgun blast approach of throwing everything into a Twitter account will not work. Companies must be selective when they are developing their Twitter presence.

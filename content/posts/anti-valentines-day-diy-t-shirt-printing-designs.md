Valentine's Day is just around the corner and everyone goes out to buy flowers and chocolates to celebrate love. Who says you have to as well! Don't be like everyone else – wear your individuality on your sleeve; or in this case your T-shirt and send out a different message this Valentine's Day; something like "_I think, Therefore I am single!_"

[![Valentine's Day](/blog/images/archive/2014/02/2014-valentines-day-TI.jpg)](/blog/images/archive/2014/02/2014-valentines-day-TI.jpg)

So we thought we'd put together a DIY T-shirt design for you this February – so you don't have to join the chorus of all the bleeding hearts out there and make your own bold, proud-to-be-single statement to the world. **So here's what you will need for your Anti-Valentine Day DIY Tee:**

* Your trusty inkjet printer (make sure the [ink cartridge](https://www.tomatoink.com/) is not exhausted)
* T-shirt transfer papers (available in Wal-Mart, Michael's or any good art & craft, or hobby shop; you may also want to check online)
* A tee of choice
* Parchment paper
* Craft knife
* Iron

If you want your DIY tee to turn out well, you want to get good quality t-shirt transfers and also ensure that the material of the t-shirt is good quality. This will reduce chances of the transfer cracking and peeling off from the t-shirt. Also, check the type of transfers you get – whether you want black inkjet transfers or some other type – the transfers should be compatible with the type and color of tee you plan to use.

## Here's what you need to do:

* Click on this DIY T shirt link to view the PDF file – this is your t-shirt design
* Print this out using the highest quality print setting on your printer – let this dry and set for about 30 minutes
* Now carefully cut along the edges of the design using a blade or a craft knife, or whichever implement you're comfortable with
* Plug in your iron and heat it up to its highest (hottest) setting
* Peel the top layer off your t-shirt transfer and very carefully place this on your t-shirt – make sure it is aligned properly. Once its stuck, you're pretty much stuck with a crooked design logo on your tee, so be careful
* Now place parchment paper on the transfer and again, very carefully iron all this together, concentrating on the edges (this is where the transfers are most likely to come away from the tee)
* No! Don't wear your Tee just yet! Wait for 15-20 minutes and then repeat the ironing process so that the transfer adheres really well to your t-shirt
* Now you can go and flaunt your Anti-Valentine's Day sentiment!

Curious Matter Paper

A lot of attention is given to the power and abilities of laser toner, inkjet cartridges, and how large or cost-effective these are going to be. However, it's also important to keep in mind what the finished product is going to look like after the printing is done, and that's where the Curious Matter line of paper from UK producer Antalis comes into play.

Created as a by-product of potato starch, Curious Matter is a paper suitable for displays and cartons that offers a feel similar to fine sand or silk, making it stand out from other products as soon as the customer picks it up. At the same time, the paper is suited to lamination, folding, laser cutting, and various other techniques to help manipulate it and improve its overall level of applications. Curious Matter isn't stocked at the world's best [printer ink cartridge](https://www.tomatoink.com/) store, since it's very much a specialty product at the moment, but it does offer us the chance to re-examine the papers we're currently using for our home and business needs.

Most people focus on the two most important [types of paper for their needs](https://www.tomatoink.com/paper), which includes basic printing paper (especially suitable for text and inexpensive enough to be purchased in bulk) and glossy paper (better for photographs, especially if they'll be given to others). It's important to remember what printers are capable of printing well on what papers, but for the most part, paper isn't usually considered a subject that's too much of a concern.

This view isn't entirely wrong, but it does tend to limit your options. For example, high-quality photo paper comes in several varieties, each of which is suitable for particular applications. [Matte](https://www.tomatoink.com/paper/photo-paper/matte) paper can help enhance the texture of a print, which is good for scenic shots, while [lustre](https://www.tomatoink.com/paper/photo-paper/lustre) paper is unusually good for portraits and wedding pictures. [Canvas](https://www.tomatoink.com/paper/photo-paper/canvas) paper has an extremely distinctive texture to it that lends itself well to scrap-booking and the like, and normal [glossy](https://www.tomatoink.com/paper/photo-paper/glossy) paper looks smooth and shiny even when not placed under glass. Plenty of other types of paper exist as well, from heavier lines that offer enhanced durability to some papers that are only used in very specific applications, such as security paper that makes it incredibly difficult to forge certain documents.

People are continuing to work on their lineups of products to create the most suitable papers for various needs, and as paper diversifies, businesses may very well begin purchasing different varieties to use in their day-to-day routines. Just be sure to keep in mind that different inks will interact with papers in different ways; sometimes the changes are subtle, other times they're more pronounced. Outside of cost, you should always consider how you want your finished products to look and which forms of printing and paper will be most suitable for that purpose. Once you've taken care of those details, the rest is straightforward and pretty easy to handle no matter how large or small your business actually is.

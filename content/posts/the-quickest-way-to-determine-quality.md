When dealing with an online retailer the first time, do not take it for granted that they have good customer service - this is the easiest thing to verify before you hit the pay button, and usually takes less than a few minutes.Customer service is very important to businesses who are interested in building a business which will last a long time - such companies, no matter what they sell, know that the most important part of any business is first and foremost how you treat your customer.

Of course, the most important part of customer service is making sure that your product or service is the best possible, and this is especially true in the field of printing supplies. Toner cartridges and laser toner cartridges, as well as inkjet and [compatible ink](https://www.tomatoink.com/) cartridges can be made much less expensively by companies who specialize in remanufactured and compatible printer ink cartridges.

**WHAT TO LOOK FOR; IF IT'S NOT THERE, YOU SHOULDN'T BE EITHER** 

A company which puts the hard work into making a great aftermarket printer ink cartridge or laser toner cartridge is not going to skimp when it comes to supplying great customer service. The website itself is also a good indicator that you are dealing with a company which is intent on providing the best quality product and which is interested in making sure that their customer's satisfaction is their number one goal.

Especially with printing supplies like ink cartridges, the company you are considering should sell only ink and printer cartridges - this is a demanding, exacting business, and the best retailers of OEM quality remanufactured and compatible cartridges will generally no do anything but this. If the ink cartridges are jammed in with other products that is a clear indicator that they are in the ink cartridge business for a quick profit and that they have not put the requisite work into developing and manufacturing a product which will meet the same specs as the OEM equipment that originally came with your printer.

Have a list of questions, and before you buy from a company you have not dealt with before, check their website and customer service for several things.

**CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SATISFACTION SHOULD BE GOAL # 1**

First, the website should be clear and concise, and should offer multiple ways to find the exact product name and number that you need as well as offering information and tips on how to install and get the best use out of the products which you are considering buying.

They should also go into detail about their manufacturing methods and the care they take to ensure that their customers are getting the same high quality black and white and color prints that their customers have grown accustomed to with the original cartridges that were supplied with their new printer.

After you have ascertained the quality of the website and familiarized yourself with their manufacturing and warranty and customer care ethos, give them a call or if they have live chat initiate a chat sequence, and have a small list of questions ready.

This can include questions about your specific printer model and exactly which remanufactured or compatible printer ink cartridges and laser toner cartridges, their manufacturing and quality control systems and their warranty. On the warranty, the length of the warranty is very important with ink cartridges, and another good indicator of a company is how hard the warranty is to activate if something does go wrong.

All this takes just a few minutes, but it can be worth it immediately - you can save up to 80% off getting original equipment directly from the printer manufacturer, and remanufactured and compatible cartridges can deliver crisp, clear prints that are every bit as good as the original cartridges installed in your printer when you bought it.

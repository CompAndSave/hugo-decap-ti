For all those who believe that Valentine's Day is about showing how much you care rather than about how big expensive your gift is, this DIY post is going to be very interesting. Now is the time to get together a few things from around the house and to put on your thinking cap to make fun, thoughtful, and memorable gifts or keepsakes for this special day of love. Here are some DIY Pinterest Gift Ideas for Valentine's Day:

### **The ‘I Love You' Banner**

Don't cringe yet! It doesn't have to say only ‘I love you' and it doesn't have to be bright red either. It can say anything that you truly feel and want to convey and it can be as sober as you want it to be. Take photo paper or stiff card paper sheets of the same size and use your home printer to print out one letter on each of the sheets.

So if you're saying ‘I Love You' you need eight sheets, and so on. You could even take bigger sheets and put one word instead of a single letter on each of them – so if you're saying "You're My Reason for Living" you need 5 sheets. You can now string these together or join them together to make a banner.

### Matching T-Shirts

They could be schmaltzy as you want or as pert and tongue in cheek as you want. So pick images and text to go along with it; look for cute his and hers motifs. Last year we had the idea to do [an Anti Valentine Day t shirt post](https://www.tomatoink.com/blog/posts/anti-valentines-day-diy-t-shirt-printing-designs.html). You can use the same procedure to create matching Valentine's Day t shirts for him and her as well this year. You can actually do this at home with your printer, t shirt transfer papers, parchment paper, an iron, and of course t shirts.

### A Collage of Your Pictures

Create wall art from a bunch of pictures specially picked and printed for the occasion. Or print out a few special pictures (a series of pictures representing a story of your relationship could be a good idea) and have them mounted or framed. Since you're printing the pictures at home, you could add some text and messages that help to convey your emotions as well.

And there is no reason to limit gifting a picture collage only to your significant other – grandparents would adore such a collage of their grandchildren, the doting aunt would love a collage that featured the extended family and so on. This can be a great gift even for a BFF – a sort of pictorial history of the friendship!\
Other Valentine's Day Printables

You could also print out Valentine's Day greetings for the special love of your life, a friend or any family member as well. You can also print out cute bookmarks that say something cute or have a special photo or image. (How about a cute little owl motif along with the words, "Owl be yours forever" or "owl be my BFF forever" … you get the drift).

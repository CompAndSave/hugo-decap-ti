Having compatible parts for your printer(s) is a very important consideration, especially if your business goes through a lot of ink in the course of your day-to-day operations. In fact, parts compatibility is so important that you might even look to purchase an older printer model just so you can have it be compatible with the cartridges you're already using. Adding onto that is the fact that there can be so many different cartridges and you've got a serious issue on your hands.

Today, we're going to cover some of the basics of [purchasing cartridges online](https://www.tomatoink.com/) and ensuring that everything is fully compatible. If you have an existing setup for printing, then you're probably familiar with the need to match the manufacturer and cartridge numbers, so searching for these at an [online cartridge store](https://www.tomatoink.com/) is a fairly easy task. In fact, even if you aren't comfortable with the search results, you can often narrow down your search by finding the manufacturer, then the model of printer you're actually using. If you don't have an old cartridge box on hand, you should be able to reference the owner's manual either in print (if you saved it) or online (often from the manufacturer).

What's not quite so easy is searching for compatible or [remanufactured cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/environmentally-friendly-green-ink-and-toner-cartridges), each of which tends to be much less expensive while still meeting (or exceeding) the original manufacturer's standards. These are often mixed in with the standard results for a particular printer, so it's very important to pay attention to the names of each product before you add them to your cart.

If you're considering adding printers or otherwise creating a new network, with new cartridges, then you'll want to know where your supplies will be coming from and how long they'll take to arrive. Before you buy a printer, you should check two important details with your ink dealer to help avoid situations where you run out of ink. The first question you should ask is how much stock your supplier normally has on hand. Even companies that buy in bulk have a limited amount, and you'll want to be certain that they normally stock enough to meet your needs (along with the needs of everyone else using the same cartridges). The second detail to be aware of is whether or not the manufacturer is intending to continue production of the cartridges for some time, and if not, whether compatible cartridges will be produced and made available. In some cases, especially with older products, the manufacturer may discontinue support before you've finished using the printer and this could wind up giving you a lower return on your investment...Not to mention leaving you scrambling for a replacement if you've burned through what you have.

As you can see, buying printers and ink isn't always as simple as just locating them in a store. With a little foresight and contact, though, you can ensure that your home or business will get the very best return on your investment.

![diy stickers ](/blog/images/archive/2015/09/diy-stickers.jpg)No one in the world is quite like you; so why should your home and the things you have in it be like any other single person in the world? There was a time when only the super rich could afford to have things customized but now a printer in every home lets anyone customize all sorts of things: wall decals, posters, customized stickers, personalized labels and so much more! Customizing your own stickers helps you make a very individualistic statement and is is fun and economical (commercial sticker printing or using a sticker machine can be a lot more expensive).

## How to Print Stickers at Home and What you Will Need

There is little you need other than a printer, paper and some imagination! As is the case with most graphic printing, an inkjet printer usually works better than a laser printer. In addition you will need sticker paper (Inkjet Sticker Film aka Inkjet Vinyl Self Adhesive) or even regular computer paper or photo paper to print out your wall stickers, labels, bike stickers or whatever it is your project involves. Glossy finish sticker paper could also work to create DIY skins for your laptop or phone. Here's a great video for tips on how to make DIY stickers below.

Check out the many options we have for different varieties of photo paper, transfer paper, magnet sheets and even printable fabric at some really attractive prices. If you're using a printable vinyl surface for your sticker/label printing, you may need dye or pigment ink (the package instructions will tell you about specific requirements). Spot inks and UV stable inks could also be indicated for custom stickers. However in many cases, just your regular toner or ink cartridge will work just as well. Also be sure to check out the amazing deals you find in our Refill Kit/Bulk Ink segment as well.

When it comes to actually printing your stickers, you can have a lot of fun experimenting with colors, designs, images, text fonts, filters and so on. Ensure that your image is scaled up or down to the size of the actual printout you want. If you're using regular paper or photo paper there are really no specific instructions to follow. However if you're using sticker paper or vinyl, follow the package instructions to get the best results. Once you have your printouts, simply cut to the shape and size required.

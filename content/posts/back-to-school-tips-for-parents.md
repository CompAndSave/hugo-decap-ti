Getting back to school or college to start a new academic year can be a considerable expense. It can also be confusing to decide exactly what to buy and how to make the transition from vacation to school day. We hope to make things a little easier for you with the help of some of our tips and recommendations for getting back to school:

### Plan ahead

[![](/blog/images/archive/2014/08/BTS-Title-ParentTips-400x265.jpg)](/blog/images/archive/2014/08/BTS-Title-ParentTips-400x265.jpg)

It's a good idea to do your shopping in advance for school and college reopening. This way you have enough time to find out exactly what's required and what is already available in the house. Planning ahead will also help avoid a last minute panic and rushing to buy things that were left out. So make a list, check it twice and get organized for back to school shopping.

### Check your home for what you can find

There may be books and stationery lying around the house that your child may be able to use for their school or college work. There may not be any need to make certain purchases.

### Don't buy into trends

We're talking kids and teens here, so this is easier said than done. Your child is going to want the coolest new looks that the other kids are sporting. You may want to gently suggest to your child that buying the latest trends may not be the best idea, because the clothes will look outdated soon. Instead opt for timeless classics that will look cool later as well. Opt mainly for the essentials. Also, check if the school or college has dress guidelines and conform to those.

### Take the time and shop together

Rather than letting older kids shop by themselves, accompany them so that you can guide them towards the essentials and away from the more frivolous stuff.

**Tip:** give in to a few of the more reasonable frivolous demands if you don't want a rebellion on your hands.

### Get back on schedule

Vacations tend to throw regular schedules off kilter. So get your child used to a regular bedtime and wake-up times, as well as meal times, ahead of the first day of school to make the transition from vacation to workday easier.

### Check the sales and tax holidays

Some states offer tax holidays on several back to school supplies. So prices for a lot of these items are typically lower during these times. Retail outlets, as well as online stores, also have special discounts and sales at this time. So take advantage of these special offers.

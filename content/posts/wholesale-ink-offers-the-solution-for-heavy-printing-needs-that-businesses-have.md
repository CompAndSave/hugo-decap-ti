TomatoInk Offers 1 Year Money Back Guarantee on all products!

Many businesses own and operate at least one printer for a variety of reasons, but some locations need more than just the occasional [replacement cartridge](https://www.tomatoink.com/). This is especially true for any corporate office or other location that employs a large number of people in an office setting, all of whom are likely to have their individual needs for printing. With a few hundred or a few thousand people all using a machine on a regular basis, ordering ink cartridges individually may not be a very practical way to go about things. Fortunately, there is a solution.

Wholesale [ink cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) are sold in quantities that can only be described as bulk. Typically sold in packs of ten or more, [wholesale ink](https://www.tomatoink.com/wholesalers) offers fantastic value in addition to the capacity to print a whole lot of material. However, the price of the ink really is the most important consideration here, because any business that actually needs to buy ink wholesale is already facing significant expenditures on their ink. Depending on the specifics of the business, some are spending hundreds of dollars a week (or more) on ink simply because of the size of the business and the need to keep it running effectively. Thus, even a small change in the price of the ink can equal major savings over time.

Tomatoink is proud to offer additional benefits to customers who purchase ink wholesale, including a money back guarantee for a full year that covers each and every order. Some businesses simply want to make one large purchase on an occasional basis rather than order ink each time they begin to run low, and this extended policy means that for most wholesale packs, the ink can be used in a ratio of one cartridge a month and still offer plenty of time to send it back if the business is anything less than completely satisfied with the order.

Alternately, it may simply be the case that a printer breaks down and needs to be replaced, in which case the ink cartridges may no longer be compatible with the printer itself. The extended return period makes it much easier to offload any cartridges that weren't use and replace them with an order for cartridges that will actually be compatible.

[Wholesale ink cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/wholesalers) are only offered for some cartridge lines. However, if you plan to make a particularly large order of ink, feel free to contact the TomatoInk [customer service team](https://www.tomatoink.com/contact) and talk with us about your options. Depending on how much ink you intend to buy, we may be able to arrange for wholesale pricing of the product. Even when this isn't an option (which, unfortunately, is the case all too frequently), you can still rest easy in the knowledge that TomatoInk offers some of the most competitive pricing and fantastic deals on ink that you're going to find. From new and re-manufactured cartridges to combo packs and wholesale bulk orders, TomatoInk is your number one location for ink orders regardless of how much you need or what printer your home or business is using.

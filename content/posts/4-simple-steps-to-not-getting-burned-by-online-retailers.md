When looking for a good company to do business with, it is even harder when you are dealing not with a store that you can visually inspect but a website. It is easy enough to set up a slick looking site which appears good on the surface but does not deliver quality goods.There are, though, a few things you can do to make sure the company you are considering dealing with is worthy of hitting the 'Buy' button.

The first of these is customer service, and that is probably also the most telling thing which will speak to the quality of the company and their products. This is especially true in the field of ink and [toner cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/). It is possible to save a great deal of money on remanufactured and compatible cartridges, but there are plenty of suppliers out there who have not done the hard work necessary to earn your trust and your business.
## GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE SHOULD BE PARAMOUNT

When it comes to customer service, does it take a long time to connect to an actual person, whether through chat or the telephone? Do they answer your questions quickly and completely, and what types of warranty to they offer? This is how you can judge whether a company is actually interested in supplying a good product, and it is easy to determine by talking or chatting to a live customer service rep - have a list of questions, but keep in mind that the real question is how fast they connect with you and how they treat you.

The next thing to realize is that to build a printer cartridge, whether it is for an inkjet printer or a laser toner cartridge is not an easy thing, especially when you are trying to deliver a product that has as good a performance as the OEM cartridges put out by the manufacturer of your printer.

## MANUFACTURING ETHOS - MAKE SURE THEY HAVE DONE THE HARD WORK

Pay special attention to the way the online retailer talks about how the cartridges are made and rebuilt, as this is the major factor in quality of the final product. With modern manufacturing techniques it is possible for these compatible and remanufactured products to deliver the same sharp black and white and color, so look for information in this regard.

The nest thing to do is to look at the return and guarantee that a company offers. Especially for suppliers of ink and toner cartridges, a six month warranty is the minimum, and a one year warranty is better as a lot of people simply don't use their ink cartridges very often. If they offer only a one or three month warranty that is a clear sign that the company itself does not have the faith that their products will last for the long haul.

The last thing to consider is customer testimonials and reviews - if everything else checks out, check the reviews and testimonials to see what actual customers say about the company. This will also give you a good idea of how effective their customer service department is when something goes wrong.

Use these 4 simple steps to determine how good a company is before you purchase you remanufactured or compatible ink and toner cartridges, and you won't be disappointed. Of course, the true test is in the printed page, so once you find a reliable company treat them just like a brick and mortar store - give them your repeat business, secure in the knowledge that not only are you saving big money, you are getting a great product as well.

TomatoInk Ink and Toner Cartridges

Knowledge is often the key to success, and even within the ink and printing industry, this is often the case. For many people, their considerations on ink begin and end with replacing cartridges inside of their printer when the cartridges begin to run low, but for the serious business or home location, there are a variety of other important things to know, especially when you want to [buy ink online](https://www.tomatoink.com/).

Among the most significant items are the methods of manufacturing used for the cartridges. For example, while many cartridges are sold new, [others might be recycled and re-manufactured](https://www.tomatoink.com/environmentally-friendly-green-ink-and-toner-cartridges), and customers are often hesitant to purchase and cartridge marked this way. However, a [re-manufactured cartridge](https://www.tomatoink.com/help/sections/8290264394893/ink-cartridge-lingo) is actually a product that's very carefully put together, as the recycling process includes a complete disassembling of the original product as well as a thorough cleaning, a removal of parts too worn for use, and a refill of the cartridge with the appropriate type of ink.

In addition to the type of cartridge provided, [TomatoInk](https://www.tomatoink.com/) is proud to offer customers a selection of additional information on ink cartridges that they may need to know when placing an order. For example, a home or business that goes through ink very slowly may have concerns about the shelf life of the cartridge and how long it will last before the contents change and no longer offer the same high level of printing quality. Alternatively, customers may be more focused on price and looking to calculate their savings over time for buying individually, in combo packs, or wholesale (when additional options are available).

Of course, the biggest concern for [buying re-manufactured or compatible cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) (that is, cartridges that are not name brand but designed to work with the printer in question) is whether or not their use will void the warranty for the printer if it breaks down. That's a question that can be answered right here, because it's a very solid "no" under current United States law. Your printer's warranty is as protected with our alternate cartridges as it is with the cartridges sold directly by the manufacturer, and we've never been notified of a case where a customer's warranty was voided simply because they used our products.

These pieces of information are only some of the many various details that are currently offered by [TomatoInk](https://www.tomatoink.com/) for customers to review and understand. The more you print, the more important it is for you to understand what's going on and how you can save money, whether it's by ordering in bulk or making the most efficient use of your space for storage. However, if you have a question about ink that's not covered by our online guides, feel free to contact one of our customer service representatives. Chances are they'll be able to provide the information you need immediately or in very short order, allowing you to solve whatever problem you may be having and get back to whatever you were doing.

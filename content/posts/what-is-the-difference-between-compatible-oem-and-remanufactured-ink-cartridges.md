TomatoInk Compatible Printer Cartridges

In today's market there are a multitude of choices when it comes to replacing your printer's empty ink cartridges. There is a lot of misinformation out there and many companies may try to use scare tactics to force you to purchase their products. But really, this tangle of decisions is made a whole lot easier if you know a few simple facts. We're going to break down the wall of confusion and make sure that you have all the information you need when choosing replacement ink for your printer. There are three main kinds of replacement ink you may purchase, compatible cartridges, OEM cartridges, and remanufactured cartridges. Before long you'll know the pros and cons of each and be able to confidently decide what is best for you!

We'll start with [compatible cartridges.](https://www.tomatoink.com/) Compatible cartridges are pretty much what they sound like, they are an ink or toner cartridge that is compatible, meaning it will work with, your printer, but it was not manufactured by the same company that made your printer. These are third-party cartridges. You can also think of them as generic parts. They are made to work with your series and model of printer; they are just made by a different company. The pros of compatible cartridges are that they are usually cheaper than manufacturer cartridges but of comparable quality. There are some companies out there that make lower quality cartridges but if you do a little looking into the company that you are purchasing from, you can make sure a choose a company with a good reputation.

OEM often causes the most confusion among buyers, but once you know what it stands for, it is easy to understand. OEM stands for "original equipment manufacturer". All that means is that the same company that made your printer also makes the replacement ink cartridges. OEM cartridges are by far the most expensive option as it is widely known that printers are sold with a low profit margin and companies make up the lost revenue in huge margins on ink sales. There are some pros with OEM products though, like the assurance that you are getting genuine parts from the same company that made your printer. Many consumers don't feel like that peace of mind is worth the large additional cost though.

Finally there are [remanufactured ink cartridges.](https://www.tomatoink.com/) These cartridges use empty OEM cartridges that are then recycled. The empty cartridges are sent to a manufacturer who will clean and test the old cartridge, replace defective parts, and then refill the cartridge. These cartridges are then resold to consumers at a significant discount. The main advantage of these cartridges is cost savings and environmental friendliness. Because these cartridges are diverted from the landfills they would otherwise be discarded in there are definite, positive environmental impacts, and because these manufacturers are not bound by the OEM price structure, large savings are passed on to the consumer.

Whatever way you choose to replace your old ink cartridges, be sure to recycle your empty cartridges. And make sure you are dealing with a reputable company like TomatoInk when you are searching for replacement toner cartridges or ink cartridges.

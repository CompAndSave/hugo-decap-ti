For some time now, GO has been a major developer as well as a major international distributor for digital imaging products that are often used by professionals. In fact, the company's current website has been able to become one of the most visited and useful providers of a wide variety of digital imaging products. They currently have distribution hubs in more than 100 countries, and they have set up offices in the UK, Chile, Guatemala, and Colombia. This network of international partners is why the company can provide its many services, including technical support, for its quality products.

In terms of its printer ink launch, the new printer ink was shown off at the ISS Long Beach Show. This new ink offers users a lot of improvements over what they may be used to having on the shelf. The patented heat activated ink was specifically created to eliminate the necessity for the use of tacky paper. It does this by providing its own internal tack function that works in standard dye sub papers. This application is often used in the textile and apparel industry.

The company says that with this new formulation, users are able to use basic dye sublimation transfer papers and still get super-crisp and accurate color transfers. This will reduce the costs that are associated with the normal sublimation process.

In addition, it was reported that the new NeoTack Ink can reliably produce 12 color sets that include some new colors. The new colors include Neon Yellow, Neon Red, and Neon Blue. But it can also produce great results for the colors: Blue, Black, CMYK, Orange, Lm and Lc. These are able to make color gamuts that are said to be 30 to 40 percent higher than what is seen in the standard dye sublimation ink. This new ink can enhances at least four different color printers as it is able to use the traditional NeoTack Magenta and Cyan along with the popular Super Black and Neon Yellow. In addition, many other neon colors may be used in place of traditional colors.

As anyone who works with any type of [inkjet cartridge](https://www.tomatoink.com/) or system knows, clogging can be an issue. This new ink is said to have exceptional fluidity and a no-clog formula that has been tested extensively on a variety of Epson printer heads. All of this means fewer problems for those who use the ink in the daily business. This, alone, will cause many of those who are in the transfer business to take a good, long look at this new ink technology. The use of the new ink may save companies up to 25 percent on their costs. The company hopes that its new ink will someday become the standard of all dye sublimation inks.[Find the cheapest ink cartridges here](https://www.tomatoink.com/)

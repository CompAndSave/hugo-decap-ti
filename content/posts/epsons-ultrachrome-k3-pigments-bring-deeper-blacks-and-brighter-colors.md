**Epson's Entrance into the Expanded Color Arena**

Epson's entry into the expanded pigment ink field is called the Ultrachrome K3 ink. Even more than others, they have expanded the black and gray colors so that these make up fully half of the eight colors; included as well are two cyans, two magentas and yellow.

The expanded black allows for deeper looking blacks as well as increased gradation in the full range of grays. The K3 inks dramatically improve color and black and white prints, and will produce archival grade prints over a wide range of print media that have amazing color reproduction capabilities, gloss levels and which are scratch resistant. Thanks to the characteristics of the high density pigment formulations used, the colors are stable at the moment the print exits the printer.

The expanded color palette produces an extremely wide color gamut and the results are stunning. The three dimensional quality and photographic feel of the Ultrachrome inks and cartridges are the payoff for the new expanded ink technologies, and among the best of those is the Epson K3 inks.

**The Importance of the Color Black**

Incorporated into the inks is a high gloss Microcrystal Encapsulation Technology that helps to significantly reduce gloss differential. The secret to the Ultrachrome K3's startling quality across a wide platform of media, including special art papers is the expanded black tones in the K3 systems, which are capable of producing a denser black and more shades of gray than ever. Black is one of the hardest colors to reproduce, especially in printers, but the new technology which the Epson K3 pigments make possible make for deeper, richer blacks than ever before.

With two blacks and two shades of what they call 'light black' the differences are startling when compared to the results that can be found on three to six color systems. With the K3 ink technology you have the ability to print art and photos that are guaranteed to sell and which have excellent archival properties. The Ultrachrome K3 inks have light fastness ratings in color that will allow them to last up to 108 years, and over 200 years for black and white prints. That is startling for something you will be able to use in your home office, but these enhanced ink technologies are becoming more and more accessible to the end consumer.  

**New Printers on the Way to Your Desk**

As with all printer technologies, these printers will have quality remanufactured ink cartridges and compatible printer ink cartridges available soon from the bigger names in cartridge sales; if chosen with care, these products will be able to save the consumer big money on toner cartridges and compatible [ink cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) that are every bit as good as the OEM cartridges.

Look for these printers using these eight and twelve color systems hitting the consumer market soon, and then keep an eye out for the best deals on remanufactured ink cartridges and compatible toner cartridges.

Follow our tips for choosing the perfect gift that won't break the bank or your bond with the planet.

# Eco-Friendly Father's Day Gifts for Every Type of Dad

## For the Outdoorsy Dad

If your father enjoys camping, then investing in a [solar lantern](https://www.amazon.com/Solar-Camping-LED-Lantern-Flashlight/dp/B016UXQ27K/ref=as%5Fli%5Fbk%5Ftl/?tag=earth911-20&linkId=f44474b64e78b44f594484cd2401dcb3&linkCode=ktl) or [solar phone charger](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5025-521/Equatorial-Sleeping-Bag-%2B15-%2B22C?f=10+50130+50854+50873+50880) is a great way to reduce his footprint when out in the wild. You can also find [foldable plates and cups](https://www.fozzils.com), [sleeping bags](https://www.bigagnes.com/collections/sleeping-bags) made from recycled materials, and a [portable oven](https://www.sunoven.com/product/all-american-sun-oven/) that cooks food using the power of the sun. You can plant a tree in his honor or start a garden project together for a more affordable and long-lasting gift. In addition, schedule a time to enjoy an outdoor activity of his choice. Hiking, dirt biking, fishing, or cross-country skiing are all fun options.

## For the Sporty Dad

Make sure dad is comfortable while out on the field, fairway, or track with eco-conscious [shirts, shorts, and socks](https://www.rei.com/s/mens-eco-conscious-clothing?origin=web&ir=collection%3Amens-eco-conscious-clothing&page=1). If he prefers to be a spectator, purchase some [high-quality folding chairs](http://www.bellacor.com/eco-friendly-folding-chair-th.htm) for his tailgating event, made from mostly recycled materials. You can also gift a six-pack of [environmentally conscious beer](http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2016-2-march-april/green-life/six-eco-friendly-beers-for-national-beer-dayand-any-day) (served in a [recycled glass pint glass](http://www.bambeco.com/Pint-Glasses/Pint-Glasses.asp), of course). Or, if you have more dough to work with, consider flying him out to one of these [eco-friendly stadiums](https://redesignreport.com/6-most-eco-friendly-sports-stadiums-in-the-world/) for a live game!

## For the Culinary Pro Dad

Any grill-loving dad would love a set of bamboo BBQ utensil gift set and all the tools he needs to make sure his [grill clean-up](http://www.care2.com/greenliving/tips-for-cleaning-your-grill-naturally.html) is as green as possible. To be truly Earth-friendly, make sure to prepare plenty of vegetables on his special day. Throw some veggie burgers or veggie dogs on the grill too. For the dad who loves to spend time in the kitchen, this [decorative compost pail](https://www.amazon.com/Brushed-Stainless-Kitchen-Compost-Decorative/dp/B0043BZTBM/&tag=aolfood-20) will collect cooking scraps, this [manual espresso maker](https://www.amazon.com/ROK-Presso-Manual-Espresso-Maker/dp/B00AV1E0GI/ref=sr%5F1%5F4?ie=UTF8&qid=1496235792&sr=8-4&keywords=espresso+machine+hand) will make him swoon, and this [organic herb kit](http://olivebarn.com/organic-heirloom-seeds/herb-kits/organic-herb-garden-trio-eco-friendly-herb-kit-in-a-gable-box/) will kick his cooking up a notch.

## For the Music-Loving Dad

Keep dad in touch with his favorite artists with [reclaimed wood headphones](http://ecowarriorprincess.net/2017/04/5-eco-friendly-headphones-earphones-for-the-music-lover/) or an [eco-friendly iPhone case](http://www.agreeableco.com/best-eco-friendly-iphone-case-environmentally-conscious-sustainable-wood-biodegrable/) that'll keep his contacts and tunes safe. If you're a crafty gifter, you could try your hand at making a [unique present out of vinyl records](http://homesthetics.net/21-diy-recycled-vinyl-projects-perfect-for-any-interior-design/) â€” anything from clocks to bookends to barstools. To gift a musical experience, take dad to see a local musician you will both enjoy.

## For the Dad Desperately in Need of a Break

Now everyone needs time for rest and relaxation, and that includes dad. Gift some [organic face wash](https://www.amazon.com/Face-Wash-Ingredients-Superfruit-Combination/dp/B011QT3JR4/ref=as%5Fli%5Fbk%5Ftl/?tag=earth911-20&linkId=589a420567e9e1000453e607af68b19a&linkCode=ktl) or [DIY bath soaks](http://www.homemadehomeideas.com/15-luxurious-natural-bath-recipes/) so he can unwind after a long day. Also, make his shaving routine zero-waste by giving him a [safety or straight razor](https://www.goingzerowaste.com/blog/2015/12/3/zero-waste-shaving) he can use again and again. For a mind and body reset, schedule a trip to the relaxing location of his choice. Gifting a vacation from everyday life is one of the best ways to feel appreciated and loved. If you two can spend that time together, even better.

Whatever way you decide to pamper your pops this Father's Day, be sure to make it meaningful and memorable.

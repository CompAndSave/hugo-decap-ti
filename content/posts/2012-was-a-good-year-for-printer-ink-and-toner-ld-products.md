LD Products is known for its high quality ink cartridges, [toner cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/), laser toner cartridges, compatible ink, and printer ink cartridges. Because of its high number of sales, it has invested in several key areas of its business. One major investment the company made was its move into a much larger facility. The company is now working out of 110,000 square foot facility that is located in Long Beach. The plant has been rated as a LEED Platinum. The company has been in business for only 13 years but has managed to become one of the printer ink leaders. The new facility includes a huge expansion of its warehouse space, along with a very impressive state-of-the-art system to run the warehouse. This system lets the printer ink and laser toner vendor to be able to fill thousands of more of its product packages than it was able to so in the past.

The new system will not only make it faster for customers to get their ink cartridges, toner cartridges, laser toner cartridges, or printer ink cartridges but it will also cut down on labor needs and costs. Cost savings will also be seen when it comes to sorting orders, packing those orders, and shipping them. It has been estimated that savings could reach 50 percent over what it once cost to do those same tasks.

In addition to the new facility, LD Products has also invested in its accounting systems and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning). It has also improved its call center for customer service, installing a more advanced communications system that routes communications via one central computer program. During the first part of the year, the company increased the hours of its customer service call center. Now, customers are able to contact the company by phone or email from 5:00 in the morning to 7:00 at night, PST. The center is now open for business 7 days a week. This increase in hours will certainly be appreciated by anyone who needs help or needs to place an order, and is just one of the many investments that company made last year.

2012 also saw the company begin to diversify its product lines. The company was also ready known for being a leading vendor in the toner and printer ink sector, but now is adding products other than printer ink type products. It will offer various types of office supplies as well. The well-known ink and toner vendor also invested by adding new personnel in its sales, marketing, operations, and administration departments. Yes, 2012 was a very good year for LD Products and the company is certainly investing in its future and future growth.

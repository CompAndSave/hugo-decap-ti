Mother's Day is just around the corner, and it's time to start thinking about great gifts for mom to show her how much you appreciate her. If you've already got great Mother's Day gift ideas that will celebrate your love for her, then this day should be a breeze. But all too often we get stuck in a morass when it comes to gift giving, which is just what I hope to avoid with my list of great gifts for mom. If you're stuck for an idea as to what to get her, I hope this lovingly curated list will unstick you!

# Mother's Day Gift List

### The Perfect Cup

For moms who appreciate the perfect cuppa — be it coffee or tea — you cannot go wrong with a thermal mug. Too many people forget to invest in a good thermal mug and often run around using freebie insulated mugs or flasks. It's time to put an end to all that with [this](https://www.amazon.com/Ello-Vacuum-Insulated-Stainless-Steel-Travel/dp/B01FWNIBBO/ref=sr%5F1%5F8?ie=UTF8&qid=1519019376&sr=8-8&keywords=thermal+mug&dpID=31uxACBa7mL&preST=%5FSY300%5FQL70%5F&dpSrc=srch) gorgeous number that comes with pink, coral, grey, or teal colored lids that are 100 percent leak-proof. Vacuum-insulated stainless steel keeps beverages hot for five hours and cold for ten, so if mom forgets to drink her tea right away it will still be piping hot when she remembers.

### Journals and Notebooks

Journals and notebooks are the perfect gifts for moms who like to express themselves with words or art. Whether you gift your mother a ruled notebook like [this one](https://www.redbubble.com/people/pineapplepears/works/30200692-dandelion-kisses?asc=u&p=spiral-notebook&rel=carousel) or a bullet journal such as [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MS1V9JY/ref=s9%5Fdcacsd%5Fdcoop%5Fbw%5Fc%5Fx%5F3%5Fw), be glad that you're going to be giving her the gift of organization as well as the gift of words. Don't forget to include a gift of [fine-tip pens](https://www.amazon.com/Fineliner-0-38mm-Colored-Assorted-10-Count/dp/B01N91KDWN/ref=sr%5F1%5F4?s=office-products&ie=UTF8&qid=1519023657&sr=1-4&keywords=fine+point+pens&dpID=51AEoOpj3JL&preST=%5FSY300%5FQL70%5F&dpSrc=srch)!

### Scented Candles

Scented candles are a great way to pamper mum this Mother's Day, so why not gift her a hand-poured natural beeswax and soy [candle](https://www.etsy.com/listing/511671654/?ref=finds_l) infused with a blend of magnolia, mimosa, and linden blossom, the iconic scents of spring? Or you could give her [this](https://www.etsy.com/listing/593545135/?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=scented+candle&ref=sr_gallery-1-4) gorgeous wild fig and red grape scented soy candle with a personalized message inscribed on its copper lid.

### Bath and Body

Pamper mom with these vegan and vegetarian friendly bath bombs with a hundred percent ethically sourced ingredients in scents such as rosewood, apple, and violet (New York) or Sweet Orange and Neroli (Seville). The bath bomb gift set features five dream destinations (New York, London, Seville, Berlin, and Capri) and will surely be appreciated by moms who love to — or dream about — travel. Of course, you could [make your own](https://thenerdyfarmwife.com/dandelion-bath-bombs-recipe/) bath bombs for mom if you're the crafty type.

### Jewelry

The [first set](https://www.etsy.com/listing/560023678/?ref=shop_home_active_7) features an unusual gemstone all the way from Australia — mookaite jasper. The earth-toned set will go well with almost any outfit. Or you could give mom fabulous chandelier earrings that feature hand-strung glass beads. Of course, let's not forget to honor a beloved stepmother with [this](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/528334653/step-mum-double-birthstone-charm) fabulous stepmom charm necklace.

### Home and Hearth

For instance, which mom could resist [this](https://www.etsy.com/listing/519472683/?ref=finds_l) delectable bath caddy, perfect for pampering? For the green-thumbed mom, no gift could say you love her better than [this](https://www.amazon.com/Scuddles-Heavy-Duty-Gardening-Tool/dp/B01H4LZR1E/ref=dp%5Fob%5Ftitle%5Fgarden) garden storage tote bag organizer to hold all her tools and her gardening gloves.

[These](https://www.etsy.com/listing/286181133/?ref=finds_l) hanging planters are great for more compact gardens or balcony gardens. Of course, once all the gardening is done mom can curl up on the sofa and lean against [this](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/534495976/personalised-mother-superior-cushion?ref=finds_l) cushion while nursing [this](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/269363616/personalised-mothers-day-mug?ref=finds_l) cup of very strong tea.

**Does The Quality Rival OEM Products?**

So, you have bought your new photo printer and it has come time to purchase new inkjet ink cartridges. You went to a superstore, perhaps, because it was convenient and learned to your dismay that to replace the cartridges it was going to cost more than the actual printer cost. At this point, some questions might occur to you.

Just type 'printer ink cartridges' or 'compatible ink cartridges' into Google and you will find dozens and dozens of retailers - how can you tell the legitimate retailers from the fly by night or shabbily run operations? Choosing between them becomes a task of figuring out which of these resellers is doing a good job.

The first thing you want to check out is how dedicated are they to making sure the compatible ink and ink cartridges they sell do when compared to OEM stock. If they do not perform at least as well as OEM cartridges that you would buy directly from the printer's manufacturer itself, then they are inferior cartridges.  
With modern manufacturing it is possible to get a remanufactured ink cartridge or compatible ink jet cartridge that performs every bit as good as the factory cartridges in the big box stores. This should apply to print quality and print longevity of the cartridges.

**Finding the Best Seller**

For a business to be successful, especially an online retailer some things are extremely important. The ability navigate the site and find the right product quickly is the first goal. The warranty is just as important. It should be easy to understand and implement, and short warranties are a sign that you are not dealing with a dedicated seller of ink cartridges and laser toner cartridges. All warranties should be at least six months to a year, and should be easy to act upon.

Another giveaway is what types of products they carry - dedicated sellers of ink and toner printer cartridges will usually concentrate only on those areas - they will not have lots of other products at their website, so if you see a company that sells hundreds of items, among them ink and toner cartridges like the Epson #87 T087720, it is a sign that they have not invested enough in the demanding field of [printer ink cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/).

**What to Look For**

Legitimate companies will also state clearly the standards by which their products are manufactured. If they are built to the exacting demands of the OEM products then you should see good results. Modern manufacturing makes these remanufactured ink cartridges and compatible ink cartridges, as well as toner cartridges every bit as good as the OEM cartridges.

If you pay attention, talk to the customer service to check the warranty and quality of the product and pay attention you can save big money and get thee same quality as the OEM cartridges.

## A Closer Look at Features Designed for Efficiency

Many businesses have been looking for a high-quality ink jet printer that is easy to use and full of features. That search may be over as a leading manufacturer, Videojet Technoliety of purposes including primary and secondary marking and coding applications. Because of itsogies, Inc, states that has launched its new Videojet 8510 ink jet printer. The printer can be used for a var touchscreen technology, ease of use is all but assured.

The biggest advance in the new Videojet 8510 is its ease of use. One issue many businesses have faced with their industrial ink jet printers is the complexity of getting the system to do even the simplest printing tasks. With the new ink jet printer, all functions can be accessed via the touchscreen and initiated with just a few input touches to the screen. The touchscreen inferface is menu driven and offers users a high-quality resolution that makes seeing the process as easy as accomplishing it. Because of its ease of use, new operators can be trained in a very short period of time to perform the tasks that they need to perform. The system is also said to be extremely easy to maintain.

The touchscreen interface comes in at just under 8.5 inches, making it easy to see even under a variety of lighting conditions. The system offers users quick access to important features such as checking the status of the system, print job verification, and ink cartridge levels. All of these, and more, are available right from the screen. The interface is designed in such a manner that users find it easy to use as it mimics many common computing devices that users are already familiar with. Controls are based on common sense icons which are simple to use and remember.

In terms of maintenance, the new Videojet 8510 offers users an array of helpful systems which include the ability to simply wipe the print head as it becomes soiled. Ink cartridge replacement is simple and fast and can be performed by the operator. Because the ink cartridge can be changed out in less than a minute, down time is drastically reduced. This, of course, increases production time.

The system also includes code assurance software which can be used by supervisors to help reduce coding errors during the product message set up phase. Supervisors can also choose to move the messaging creation phase from the operations floor. In fact, supervisors can even embed rules-based guidelines which can be very useful in assisting operators to select the appropriate data when those operators are setting up a printing run that may or may not involve editing the code that is to be printed on the package.

Another benefit to the system is its compact size. This makes it easy to install on print production lines and easy to maintain, as mentioned above. The system is scalable as well, allowing for production lines to use the features they need and ignore those they do not need.

Traditionally, Thanksgiving Day is thought of as the official start of the Christmas shopping season because of the Black Friday sales. 

A shopper's heaven, you can find deals on popular items like TVs and laptops both in stores and online. That said, amongst the huge savings, have you ever wondered how this American rite of passage with its crazy Black Friday TV deals came about? 

Today we're going to take a crash course into why we call the Friday after Thanksgiving Black Friday and give you a deal ourselves for cheap printer cartridges on [Tomatoink.com](https://tomatoink.com/).

### Why Do We Call it Black Friday?

There are a couple of explanations for why the day after Thanksgiving Day is called Black Friday. Typically people do a lot of shopping around this time of year and this puts most businesses in the "black" as opposed to in the "red". In other words it is believed that most retailers start to turn a profit around this year, which they may not have been able to accomplish from January through October of the year.

The term Black Friday was first used to describe heavy traffic and pedestrian presence on the streets of Philadelphia on the Friday after thanksgiving. Many retailers open their doors to customers as early 4 or 5 AM to give customers early access to the best deals.

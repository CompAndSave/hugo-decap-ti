Is buying ink in bulk the right thing to do? Today, we'll be examining some of the different reasons why people might prefer to buy in bulk...And why buying individually is sometimes the better option for homes or businesses.

Of course, at a certain point, buying in bulk is sometimes the only option that makes any sense at all. Some businesses are at a state where they are printing more-or-less constantly, sometimes from many machines at once, and there's no question at all that a lot of ink is needed to keep things running. Sheer number of machines, if nothing else, makes buying ink cartridges in bulk the only real option for the business. Other locations may be a little more relaxed, though, like small businesses or offices that need to print the occasional document but don't run through cartridges too quickly. For businesses like these, buying in bulk could be a considerable one-time expense that would tie up money better spent on other operations, making recurring orders over time a much more practical consideration.

As you can see, the most simple and straightforward answer to the question is simply figuring out how much ink the business uses and going from there. However, there are a few more considerations that a business should keep in mind.

The first is that, occasionally, there is a defect somewhere in the manufacturing process. Most printers and genuine cartridges are built to perform flawlessly for printing thousands upon thousands of pages over the course of several months, though how well this is done does depend on the make and model of the printer. Problems with cartridges can result in a huge pile of unusable items, though. The best locations, knowing that ink isn't always moved through very quickly, will offer an extended return period in case any problems do arise. Buying more frequently can help avoid situations like suddenly needing to return large numbers of [cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) and rush-order new ones, which can put a big stopper in activities like online shopping businesses where the customers need their printed receipts. No receipts could mean no shipments, and no shipments could mean a big backlog at the warehouse and all the associated problems.

The best solution is to carefully evaluate the needs of your business. First, know the shipping times for cartridges to your location, so you can time things correctly. You don't want to burn through everything you've got while waiting for a new shipment, after all. Next, pay attention to notices from your manufacturer about potential defects...But don't rush to return your products if you notice one problem. Many problems are specific to one cartridge and can be easily resolved by following some basic troubleshooting guidelines, which can save you quite a lot of time and money in the great majority of cases.

By carefully evaluating all of your options, you can make sure that your business is always [ordering the right ink cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) at the pace that's best for your company.

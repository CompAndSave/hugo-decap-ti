It is never too early to teach kids about the importance of planting and conserving trees. If you haven't already, this Arbor Day observed on the last Friday of each April (this year Arbor Day is on April 24th), is a perfect time to start. It's a great way for your kids or grandkids to learn about the importance of tree conservation, to spend quality time together and to have some fun at the same time!

Do you know, there is 9,550-year-old Spruce tree that currently exists in Sweden on Fulufjallet Mountain? Trees are the longest living things on earth; invariably a valuable investment in our own future and those of our children. So Arbor Day is probably the most meaningful observance you can celebrate with your children and grandchildren.

## What is Arbor Day?

The first reports of Arbor Day date back to 1805\. In Villanueva de la Sierra, a village in Spain, a local priest "convinced of importance of trees for health, hygiene, decoration, nature, environment and customs" decided to plant trees and give a festive air to the place on Carnival Day.

The origin of Arbor Day the United States dates back to 1872 when the efforts of J Sterling Morton resulted about a million trees being planted in Nebraska. In 1906 conservationist Major Israel McCreight convinced President Roosevelt to make a public statement to school children about trees and the destruction of American forests and a year later, Roosevelt issued an Arbor Day proclamation.

In 1972, The Arbor Day Foundation, a nonprofit conservation and education organization was founded "to inspire people to plant, nurture, and celebrate trees". Today the foundation has programs such as Nature Explore and Tree Campus USA to help parents, caregivers and teachers connect children to nature and to engage student bodies in the process of conservation.

## Fun Arbor Day Activities for Kids

### Actually Plant Trees

You could buy saplings from a local nursery or transplant saplings you have nurtured yourself. Pick tree species that are suitable for the climate and topography of the place you live. Find suitable sites where a tree is able to flourish. Get kids to help with the digging and transplanting and watering; then have them look after the tree or trees, check their progress regularly or each time they visit. This is will educate a child about the process of growth and teach them to value trees.

### An Arbor Day Ramble

The weather is great for a ramble in the woods or a park. While you're spending quality time with your child or grandchild, point out different trees, tell them a bit about them, collect different types of tree leaves and encourage them to make a scrap book out of those.

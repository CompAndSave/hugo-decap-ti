Coupons are a smart saver's best friend. Merchants and online stores offer us all these lovely discounts and/or freebies; why not take advantage of them! Some good online sources for coupons are **Coupons.com, SmartSource, RedPlum, Hopster** and **Common Kindness**. While it's a good idea to use the coupons that you find in your daily newspaper or those that arrive in the mail, it's also a _great_ idea to use online coupons. This is because you have a much wider choice online; you can find the coupon for the exact store or product you want, print it out and then use it. However, sometimes you could encounter coupon printing issues. Let's look at some common issues that people face when printing out coupons and their solutions:

### [![](/blog/images/archive/2014/09/CouponsPrinted.jpg)](/blog/images/archive/2014/09/CouponsPrinted.jpg)Check printer settings

If your coupons are not printing, make sure you've performed all the basic checks – are the printer cables properly connected? Is your printer on? Are the print and feeder trays open? Is there paper in the printer, and does your printer know that the paper is there? Print a test page of some sort to ensure that the printer itself is working properly.

Sometimes you may get the message that your "Default Printer is not supported". To resolve this problem, go to your Control Panel and select the ‘Printers' option. Then choose your printer, select properties and then go to the ‘Advanced' tab. Choose the "print directly to printer" option and click OK or apply and your problem should be resolved.

### Some coupons still won't print

So you're giving your print command but the coupon you want isn't printing. There are several things you can do to correct this:

* Try using a different browser. If you're using Firefox, try using Internet Explorer or Google Chrome or vice versa. Sometimes just using a different browser could resolve the issue.
* Another problem could be the version of Java that is installed in your computer. Performing and installing an update should resolve the issue in some cases. You may even get the Java update prompt if this is the case.
* Check your Firewall. Sometimes an anti virus program installed on your computer may be restricting the coupons from loading or printing properly. The antivirus may be viewing the pop up browser as adware for instance. So disabling the firewall or pausing your antivirus protection for a while could resolve the problem.
* Also check the settings within your browser. If browser add-ons are turned off, this could be the problem preventing you from printing out your coupon. Pop-ups could also be disabled in your browser; this could prevent the coupons from opening and printing.
* You browser could also be out of date. Try updating your browser with the latest version and then try again.

### Printing from handheld devices

Printing from tablets, smartphones and other handheld devices could sometimes be a problem as well. This is because some websites are not equipped to offer mobile versions of the coupons and may not allow printing. Sometimes it could be that the printer is not equipped to handle this type of networking or wireless printing.

### Sometimes Macs have a problem printing coupons

There could be an operating system-browser mismatch that is causing the problem. You could again try switching browsers because a lot of sites don't currently support IE on Mac machines.

So now that you've resolved some of the most common printing problems, go ahead and print coupons to your heart's content and enjoy some awesome savings!

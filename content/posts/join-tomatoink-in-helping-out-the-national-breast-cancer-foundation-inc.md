_"Having had cancer, one important thing to know is you're still the same person at the end. You're stripped down to near zero. But most people come out the other end feeling more like themselves than ever before." - Kylie Minogue on her diagnosis of Breast Cancer in 2005._

![National Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign - TomatoInk.com](/blog/images/archive/2015/09/2015-10-09-300x600.jpg)Inspiring words from singer Kylie Minogue on a life-changing event that one in eight women will face in their lifetime. To show our support this October, we are partnering up with the [National Breast Cancer Foundation Inc](http://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/).® (NBCF) to provide help and inspire hope by donating 2% of our sales. Our goal is to raise at least $3,000 to help the NBCF provide mammograms for early detection, education, and support services to those affected by breast cancer as well as their loved ones.

A little can go a long way, even by sharing some of this information in this post with friends or family. First, here's a little more about the amazing NBCF organization.

### **About the NBCF's Programs**

Started in 1991 by founder Janelle Hall's own personal experience with breast cancer, she wanted this organization to be a support system for diagnosed women and stress the importance of early detection. Today in 2015, her vision has come true with some of these excellent support programs below:

* The Early Detection Plan is designed to detect cancer in the early stages and helps you develop a plan based on your health history and age. Download the app and get reminders to do your self-exam, undergo a clinical exam or to have a mammogram.
* Beyond the Shock is an education resource for those who have been diagnosed with breast cancer. You can find questions and answers, educational videos and inspiring stories here.
* The National Mammography Program provides free screening procedures and medical facilities to the underprivileged and under-served.
* The Patient Navigator Program helps people overcome misinformation and fear. It also helps augment finances
* The Breast Health Education program consists of community outreaches all over the country that help educate people about cancer and offer early detection services
* Via their Breast Cancer Research programs, the NBCF also works with some of the finest cancer researchers to continue the quest for effective and lasting cures for cancer.

### **Tips and Facts about Breast Cancer** 

Early detection is often the key to breast cancer survival and prevention. Here are some tips and facts that might surprise you. Share them with friends and loved ones:

* Get educated about breast cancer. Dispel some of the common cancer myths and read answers to frequently asked questions about breast cancer.
* Know your own health history and that of your family; especially about close blood relatives who have had cancer.
* Learn to identify the [early signs and symptoms of breast cancer](http://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/breast-cancer-symptoms-and-signs) and also know that a majority of breast lumps are actually benign and not cancerous. Find out why it isn't irregularities per se that could be problematic, but any change that you see which could signify a problem
* Learn [how to perform breast self exams](http://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/breast-self-exam) (this is important because about 40% of diagnosed breast cancer are detected by women who felt a lump or irregularity)
* Consult a medical practitioner to know how frequently you should have a mammogram and undergo clinical exams given your age and health history
* Exercise regularly, eat healthy and maintain a healthy body weight. Make the lifestyle modifications to your life and that of your family to help boost immunity to lower your cancer risk as well as that of your family members
* Give up smoking and cut down on alcohol to lower your risk  
You can help other women in your family and friend circle by spreading this information. You can also get involved with a cancer society program in your community as a volunteer or you can actually initiate a program by becoming a sponsor. You can also make a direct donation to breast cancer research (donate once or opt for recurring donations) or other programs.

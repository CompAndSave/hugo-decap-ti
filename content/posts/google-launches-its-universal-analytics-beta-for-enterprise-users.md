## Advanced Tracking Capabilities for Large Organizations

As more and more online customers are using a variety of devices to buy products and get company information, Google is working toward solutions that can help online businesses to make sense of the new analytics that are coming out. In simple terms, Google has determined that the data gathered from websites is simply no longer enough to help businesses understand what their customers are doing and purchasing. This problem can be especially critical for large companies who have for some time now been asking for cross-platform viewing of their Google Analytics data.

The answer to this problem is called Google's Universal Analytics. With this new system, data users can now sync their own data from across a variety of online marketing channels. This allows users to better understand the relationships between those marketing channels and the data gathered from multiple touchpoints. Touchpoints include such things as laptops, phones, tablets and so forth.

The beta program was announced in 2012 as a Mobile App Analytics at I/O. To date, it is said to be delivering outstanding results for Google clients. It is also said that Universal Analytics enable users to better measure their marketing efforts more realistically by integrating data with Google Analytics accounts. Universal Analytics customers are also able to integrate their own gathered data and customize various metrics that are important to them. This data, as mentioned above, goes far beyond simple website visits.

By using this new form of data reporting, businesses are able to discover what their visitors and customers are actually doing which can help those companies to deliver better service, goods, products and user experience. Universal Analytics tools are now being offered through the new Measurement Protocol which is an API that allows users to send their data to Google Analytics. A major goal is to help companies measure (in greater detail) just how people become and remain loyal customers. It should be noted that current Google Analytics users will not see any changes to their current accounts. However, some larger enterprises can now request access to the beta version of Universal Analytics.

The tools provided through the Measurement Protocol allow users to easily and seamlessly send their data concerning their customers as well as their own business data from any digital device that the company is measuring to their Google Analytics account. The results can assist companies to see just how users are interacting with company brands as seen from various touchpoints.

As more and more companies realize how important cross-channel marketing and information is becoming, they are also becoming more interested in finding accurate measurement tools that can put all of this data together for them. This allows businesses to find the various relationships that drive visitors to becoming buyers. It can also be used to help identify problem areas which can then be addressed. Prior to the beta release, finding cross-channel problems was virtually impossible to accomplish. Because the new system is highly customizable, companies that use it will be able to get the data information that they actually want and need.

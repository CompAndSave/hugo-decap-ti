Hewlett-Packard recently unveiled a new selection of printers for the home and office designed around meeting more of a customer's needs. In any company where printing is required, quality is often a major concern, so replacing a printer is both a major investment and a serious choice throughout the process. Perhaps more importantly, though, many businesses do a lot more than simply print papers as part of their daily operations.

Having considered this, [HP LaserJet Pro MFP M521dn and HP LaserJet Pro MFP Color M570](https://www.tomatoink.com/hp-printer-cartridges) models offer something more than just the capacity to print items. In fact, each of these models adds in the ability to scan documents as well as serve as a fax machine for the business. While each feature may not be relevant to every business, many locations have a need for all three of these services and can get a lot of use out of a machine that works to provide as many services as possible.

Printing can be a very complex industry. As seen in the wide selection of [ink cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) that are available online, new printers often call for new ink cartridges and all of the associated manufacturing focus. It doesn't ever stop, either, because each of the major printer manufacturers are continually working to improve their products and offer new functionality to the printers currently being offered for sale.

With that in mind, the question becomes one of what to actually do with the printer once it's in a home or an office. This is where many businesses start to fall behind, since they don't always know the full capabilities of the products they buy. For example, a printer that possesses fax capabilities can be used to receive specific orders from a customer without requiring the customer to travel all the way to the store to deliver their instructions, and this is particularly useful in cases where their signature is needed and they can't simply fill out an online form. This paper can also be used as the receipt for the customer if designed correctly, providing added functionality throughout the process and saving on both ink and paper that might otherwise be wasted.

In the meantime, scanning offers a way to cut down on the amount of space needed to store items and provide the business with a way to start organizing and searching through important documents. With a simple connection to a computer, it becomes possible to record a variety of important items and save them long after the paper itself is gone, protecting the information for as long as the computer lasts. When used in conjunction with backup services like cloud computing, this means that none of the information will ever be lost.

It can be difficult for any business to start changing its established patterns. After all, you're usually finding yourself doing what's worked the best for you in the past, and changing to fit a machine instead of simply buying the machine that fits you can be a tough choice to make. Nevertheless, depending on your type of business, it could very well be worth it.[Subscribe to our newsletter](https://www.tomatoink.com/welcome/subscribe) and enjoy our big promotions

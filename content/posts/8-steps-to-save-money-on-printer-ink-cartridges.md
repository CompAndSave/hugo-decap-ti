**1\. Buying compatible/generic ink cartridges**

Buying generic or [compatible printer ink cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) can translate into phenomenal savings. You can save as much as 89% when you buy compatible cartridges instead of OEM cartridges.  
**2\. Buying re-manufactured cartridges**

Buying re-manufactured ink cartridges can also help you save a lot of money. These are printer ink cartridges and toner cartridges that have been recycled after use and which are then refilled with ink. These are not only an economical choice they are also an [eco-friendly](https://www.tomatoink.com/environmentally-friendly-green-ink-and-toner-cartridges) alternative.  
**3\. Buying XL sizes**

If your printing volumes are large, it makes sense to buy XL size ink cartridges. They may be more expensive, but they last much longer too.  
**4\. Regular Printing**

Regular printing is important for a long cartridge life and to get higher print counts and to prevent the printer heads drying out or getting clogged.  
**5\. Draft printing**

When possible use the draft setting for printing. This uses up a lot less ink, making your [printer ink cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/) last much longer.  
**6\. Gray scale printing**

Also when possible, use gray scale printing. Monochrome cartridges are cheaper so replacing these more frequently will be more economical than replacing color cartridges.  
**7\. Avoiding printers with combined cartridges**

Combined cartridges have a slight disadvantage: here three inks, yellow, cyan and magenta, are contained in one single cartridge. When even one of the colors runs out, the ink cartridge will need to be replaced. You need to do this even if the other colored inks have not run out.  
**8\. Do you need to print photos at home?**

You can get terrific photo printouts at home with [your printer ink cartridges.](https://www.tomatoink.com/) But do you have to do this at home? You can get your [photos](https://www.tomatoink.com/paper) printed from a high street retailer or an online print shop at some very reasonable rates. These rates could actually be lower than what it would cost you to print out photos at home. You should do a cost effectiveness check to see what would turn out cheaper for you.

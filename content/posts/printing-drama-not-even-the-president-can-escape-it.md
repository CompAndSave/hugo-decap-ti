![Printing Drama: Not Even the President Can Escape It ](/blog/images/archive/2015/09/1.jpg)

The crucial Obama speech – the Iran nuclear deal pitch at American University in Washington, D.C., this last August – was a little delayed. The reason for the delay? Toner! According to the President himself, who apologized for the delay, "E_ven presidents have problems with toner_"! So if you have faced frustration using that new wireless printer to print out that all-important letter to your congressman, or if the toner for your Canon printer ran out just as you wanted to printout your grandchild's utterly irresistible gap-toothed smile, you're not alone!

The President is, quite literally with you! If toner issues could delay the press conference of the most powerful man in this country, they most certainly can mess with your plans as well. However with a bit of planning and foresight you can stay a step ahead of toner issues that may crop up with your LaserJet printer.

### TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS, TONER ISSUES AND FIXES

The first thing you want to do is look after printer repair and maintenance. In other words keep your printer serviced and in good working order so it doesn't spring any nasty surprises when you can least afford it. Ensure that your cables and their connectors are properly connected. If you're using a wireless printer, make sure it is properly configured to the device that you're printing from.

If your printout is too slow, check your print settings. Change to draft mode (most Windows computers will let you do this very easily) which will give you decent quality, but a lot quicker. You can change your settings later when your toner is running a little low and the printout readability appears to suffer. Keep giving your printer a work out now and then; particularly if yours is an inkjet printer. All too often, low printout quality is caused by nothing more than a clogged or dry print head. Even if your cartridge is nearly full, infrequent use could cause problems.

For problems such as leaking cartridges, dealing with a low ink message, printer not recognizing the cartridge, be sure to visit our [Ink Toner Troubleshooting ](https://www.tomatoink.com/help/categories/8354812380557/troubleshoot)segment.

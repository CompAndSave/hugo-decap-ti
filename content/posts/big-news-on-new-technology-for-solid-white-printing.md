For many businesses, the ability to print solid white has been a dream not accomplished when it comes to solid white printing that is both fast and cost effective. Well, that has changed now. It was recently announced that OKI Europe has now developed an innovative printing solution that handles white printing with the introduction of their digital LED A4 and A3 white toner printers.The company states that its new models, the C711WT and C920WT, have resolved the problems white printing has heretofore faced and these models can address issues ranging from simple T-shirt transfers to film printing and much more, including an innovative system that can be used via in-store point-of-sale applications.

These white toner models have been thoroughly tested by targeted small and medium business (SMB) customer and have been shown capable of producing high-quality output. They have also been shown to be cost effective which makes them a perfect match for most graphic-based industries.

OKI is considered to be the first company to introduce a toner-based printing solution for the "white printer" industry. Their new models are expected to be tough competition for other technologies that have been complex and expensive to operate. According to Paul Ingram, OKI product marketing manager in Europe:

"In the past, products have been based on inkjet, dye sublimation or transfer film-ready technologies. These have niche applications in areas such as garment decoration or printing proofs for packaging applications which are typically expensive both to purchase and maintain and the production time is lengthy. The new OKI white toner-based products by contrast are versatile, easy to use and, as there is no drying time required, enable much faster and more cost-effective printing. At the same time, the robust solid print output is just as good as foil blocking, making it a credible in-house solution for a wide range of white print applications."

In terms of targeted markets, the models were designed to meet the approval of both small and large users. The C711WT A4 printer offers 4-colour (CMY and white) printing, at 8ppm in transparency mode and 34ppm using plain paper. This should appeal to smaller markets.
By contrast, the C920WT A4/A3 printer is designed for higher volume applications, at 10ppm and 31ppm respectively (A4), with higher capacity [toner cartridges](https://www.tomatoink.com/). And this should appeal to larger user markets.

For now, these white toner printers are aimed at a number of key markets, including transfer media printing, ceramic decoration, back light signage by transparency film and, of course, film printing for packaging. Also, they will appeal to point-of-sale signage opportunities for glass or window displays in retail outlets. Both the C711WT and C920WT models offer users faster printing and are easier to operate since users can load and print multiple sheets with its output offering consistent high quality. For those who have been waiting for quality, affordable white printing, this may be the solution they have been dreaming of for years. More information concerning each model can be found online and is well worth looking into if you need reliable white printing solutions.
